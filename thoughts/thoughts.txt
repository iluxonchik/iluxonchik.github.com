if you think they crypto will replace banks, you don't understand what banks are and how they work

banks are credit institutions. it doesn't matter if they process transactions in COBOL, Bitcoin or Solidity

DLTs can and will save on costs, but that will also open opportunities for banks to expand further

it's not about the underlying technology - the credit can be issued on-chain via tokens, but there will still be heavy regulations and authorization requirements

DLTs/blockchains won't magically replace banks

Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin

TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.

Bitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. 

While gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.

Gold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.

Electronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. 

Digital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them

This is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition

silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend

this represents a ≈27% correction from the top

this is the lowest possible bottom for this move - it probably won't go this low. if it does, the move will happen fast, so have your buy limit orders ready. next week is FOMC interest rate decision. the Fed will cut the rates by another 25bps, and other things equal - it's positive price pressure for silver

if the price breaks below $47, it will likely fall closer to $45. expect a stronger support in the $43-45 area

overall, any prices in the vicinity of September 15th 2025 prices is a GREAT buying opportunity

* keep in mind the total 75 bps interest rate cut by the Fed this year is already in progress of being priced in - the market doesn't wait for the official announcement. this is one of the reasons why you had so much upside price volatility in the last month

Bitcoin isn't private - at best it's anonymous

and this is by design. it's just cryptography/math - not much to argue about

but gold transactions aren't private either. most of the time they're not even anonymous. you must have some level of trust with the counterparty - either directly or via intermediary. a lot of the times this is required by law

at retail level, there is much more privacy and anonymity with Bitcoin that with gold

gold has clearly more intrinsic value than bitcoin, but bitcoin is one of the most significant advancements in money. although bitcoin isn't money 😄

my vibe meter on Bitcoin is off the charts 📈*

the algorithm on X has been pushing a lot of pro-BTC content over the past month, and it's becoming more and more irrational: 

accounts with millions of followers recycling 2024 news about "new" gold reserves in China, false news about China legalizing Bitcoin and calls for gold going down to $2000

every pro-Bitcoin account seems to be calling a long-term gold top (LOL!) and heavy rotation into Bitcoin. actually a lot of BTC shill content is about BTC being better than gold - and the arguments for it aren't very sound. i've written several posts explaining this. BTC crowd seems very obsessed about gold - especially when it comes to showing how it's inferior to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not gold - and it will never be gold - they're very different assets. that doesn't mean that BTC ownership is a bad idea - but it's important important to approach it rationally 

a large part of this seems coordinated/paid campaigns. liquidity always needs an exit

so Bitcoin should continue with some more downside in the near future

BTC went from $0.004 to $110,000 USD in 16 years, but gold was never this cheap in over 5000 years

Going back to the start of recorded price systems - gold's starting price per gram is ≈100 days of labor! This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago

So using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today's USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it's useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold's USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.

Will Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form. Gold (Au) hasn't changed in 13 billion years

Bitcoin promo accounts love to compare BTC to gold, and they frequently cite that BTC is up much more than gold over the last 16 years. The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent

What the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived. As such, such comparisons fail short

They also seem to selectively omit the massive volatility - gold doesn't go down 80% every other day/cycle top

The gold prices here I computed are estimates - don't take them as hard quantitive data. Read this in the context of comparing the price of gold and Bitcoin. If someone's argument is that Bitcoin is better than gold because it had a higher percentual return in 16 years - it likely lacks substance

1. Bitcoin is not money. Calling it money won't make it money

2. Digital currency designs existed before bitcoin - and double spending wasn't an unsolvable problem

3. Again, bitcoin is not money and all it takes is for your government to declare it illicit to censor it. Bitcoin is not private - you will be tracked if needed & in many ways it's much easier than with banks

I'm a big fan of Bitcoin, DeFi & crypto in general, but that doesn't mean reality should be skewed

Remember that lot of accounts posting non-stop pro-BTC/crypto content are paid for it - directly or indirectly. Another large portion of  them are automated/bots.

FYI you can ask the bank to lend you ≈75%LTV of the future property before restoration works start

so assuming you have a real estate project for restoration - the bank estimates the future value (after the immovable property is restored) and lends ≈75% of that expected future value. if you lease the property instead of buying - banks can generally finance 100%

in restoration projects the bank may also agree for a lower installment payment schedule while the works are ongoing/the property business is being setup - e.g. for the first two years of the loan you're only paying interest installment portion without amortizing the outstanding principal amount

otherwise you'll need another way to finance the restoration costs, and I doubt the contracting company will agree to only receive payment once your loan gets approved

no, permissioned assets running on blockchains are NOT sheep in wolves' clothing

blockchains need to integrate with our existing legal systems - and the permissioned aspect is often required by law

i'm currently looking into implementing a real estate European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) on-chain with smart contracts

the EU regulations governing such funds explicitly require a permissioned control. for example, an ELTIF must be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), as per Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD). so there must always be an AIFM behind the token/smart contacts. it can't just be "ownerless" decentralized contracts. by design that someone also bears legal responsibility

you're also legally not allowed to allow retail investments into the fund without KYC, which is also a permissioned component

in order to be able to have the unit's funds tradable on-chain without qualifying as a trading venue under MiFID II (so you don't need additional licenses), you may want to use ELTIF RTS, which under certain conditions exempt your ELTIF smart contracts from being classified as a multilateral system. to qualify for this exception, the law requires the manager to operate windows, decide on execution prices, etc - i.e. the fund's units get traded in a permissioned manner

these are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets

permissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure

neither supply nor demand are static

if you renew a building in a high demand area you're removing an abandoned/old property from an area, which makes the area "nicer", thus it becomes more attractive = more demand

you're also probably will be renting more than the area average (it's a new construction now)

imagine doing this in an almost central part of a high demand city

so renting a building can actually bring prices in the area up instead of down

still - more building is better!! it does put downwards pressure on the real estate prices - but you're looking in the wrong place. you should be looking at credit instead. i wrote an article to get you started here: https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html

retail CBDCs are direct central bank liabilities on the balance sheet. so "neutral market infrastructure" would not work, because the ECB needs to have full control over it. you can also imagine how many regulations need to be accounted for by the implementation

it most likely won't use a public blockchain for base implementation, and it's definitely not like stablecoins 😄

no, "The West" is not manipulating gold and silver prices

silver and gold had retracements many times before, but I guess when it falls on Chinese holidays it becomes "western manipulation"?

≈32% of global gold demand in 2025 comes from China (estimate for jewelry + bar & coin). China is a major buyer of gold - so a lot of demand there

a more reasonable explanation is a demand dip, due to the holiday in PRC. also the US government shutdown. although I agree the idea of a magic red button saying DUMP GOLD located somewhere in the west is more exciting 😄

it's also not clear what would be the purpose of manipulating the price of gold down, as that would be benefiting China - they can buy it cheaper!

PBoC has been buying gold for years, and they will continue to do so. PBoC doesn't announce targets publicly - and they're flexible on their purchases, so again, lowering the gold price would likely allow them to buy it at a cheaper price

Bitcoin is not a good collateral for a loan, here's why:

1️⃣ You can only get ≈50% LVT credit
2️⃣ You pay higher interest than on mortgages/real estate-backed loans
3️⃣ You get liquidated from ≈80% LVT

So if your strategy is to purchase assets and use them as collateral for loans, you may be better off with real estate:

1️⃣ You can get more than 75% LTV credit
2️⃣ You'll pay lower interest for a mortgage/real estate-collateralized loan than for a BTC collateralized loan
3️⃣ No liquidations when real estate is collateral. If property (collateral value) falls, you may be requested a cure, but forced sales must go though courts.

the majority of real estate purchases in Portugal are done with credit. moreover, each property itself can be used  as a collateral to get more credit - at least 75% of the property's value. so not only you can purchase the property, earn a yield via rents, but also get a credit/loan for 75% of value of the property

in Portugal, ≈90% of all credit/loans against real estate, go into investing into more real estate. so each collateraized property, can contribute ≈2x of its value as buying pressure for the real estate market as a whole (1x when the property is first purchased, and 0.75x-1x when the property is used as collateral to get a loan against it)

so effectively real estate itself is driving real estate prices up. banks happily finance real estate acquisitions, and lend against real estate collateral. then, most of that credit goes into purchasing more real estate, thus pushing the prices up

so the main drivers behind increasing real estate prices in Portugal are:

the real estate itself, i.e. the property itself
funding rate/cost of credit (highly influenced by ECB policy rates)
low relative transaction volume/market cap, making it easier to move the median

the first two points are generally universal across the globe. i've previously written an article about what makes real estate such a special asset from the point of view of financing. you can read it here: https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html

the relatively low total transactional volume, which has increased almost x3 in the past decade - makes it "easier" for buying pressure to push the housing prices up

of course, other factors contribute as well. Portugal is highly demanded area for cultural and geographical reasons - i.e. locals are welcoming and Portugal has a huge coastal area. there is also high inflation, regulatory challenges and supply chain limitations

the bottom line is that real estate purchase and rent prices in Portugal will continue to increase over medium-long term

📖 Quoting from 2025-09-27 11:19:
┌─ portugal golden visa real estate investments are less than 3% of total housing transactions
│ 
│ portuguese real estate market volume is ≈30B€/year, golden visa purchases accounted for ≈556M€/year
│ 
│ 3% of total volume of the housing market is unlikely to be the primary driver of the national median prices increase

if you buy a car with Bitcoin, you're still subject to capital gains tax

under the US law cryptocurrencies are property - so you're taxed on the USD value of the car at the time of purchase minus the cost of your original crypto purchase (so you're only taxed on the gain/profit)

so if the processing fee of a payment with Ethereum is larger than it would be by selling Ethereum for USD first (e.g. transfer ETH to an exchange --> sell --> transfer to your bank account), then you end up paying more with Ethereum than you would with USD. it make sense, because you'd be removing an intermediary (i.e. you sell ETH for USD yourself)

in either case, the seller receives USD for the car, not ETH or BTC. the intermediary most likely doesn't keep ETH/BTC on their balance sheet either, they just proxy your order to the market and charge a spread

central banks have rejected holding Bitcoin in their reserves including Fed, ECB, PBoC and many others

what would even be the purpose of a central bank holding BTC on their balance sheet? so that they can stabilize the value of the currency against Bitcoin? what would be the practical benefit from it now?

cross-border crypto trade in non-stablecoins is negligible. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which would make central-bank issued currency more volatile - this goes exactly against the direct mandate of most central banks - price stability.

a more volatile currency will also lead to a more volatile bond market, which will make government funding more volatile, and thus a high risk/uncertain economy

and i'm not even going to touch on the security risks. okay, maybe briefly 😄:

➖ governments are one of the only entities that can realistically perform a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin. well, with central banks owning BTC will make such attacks much more attractive - including at the geopolitical level. the same goes for denial of service family of attacks

➖ what if the central bank's wallets get hacked/compromised? i'm not talking about quantum computers breaking RSA, but operational level mistake or compromise

so for the next 10 years, I view central banks holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet as a negative sign for their currency. of course, the protocol and the bitcoin network will evolve/change over time, and with so may my stance

i believe cryptocurrencies, and more specifically distributed layer technologies/blockchain architectures can bring immense value to our financial system as a whole, but that doesn't mean that we should have central banks speculating on that today. it makes much more sense to increase gold reserves instead

virtually every corporation that accepts Ethereum/Bitcoin for payments doesn't actually process the payment in crypto

they immediately covert it to USD or another FIAT, and not actually hold the BTC, ETH, etc

the convertion is generally done via an intermediary, so the company you're buying never even touch or care about the crypto asset. they want the same government-backed currencies that we use now

the intermediary will also generally charge a fee, around ≈1% of the transaction value. so buying directly with crypto is likely to be more expensive than directly with FIAT. if you just sell the crypto for FIAT and pay directly in USD, EUR, etc it will likely be cheaper. so what's the point of paying more?

portuguese real estate market volume is ≈30B€/year, golden visa purchases accounted for ≈556M€/year

3% of total volume of the housing market is unlikely to be the primary driver of the national median prices increase

so next time someone tells you that one of the main drivers behind increasing Portuguese real estate prices are golden visa investments - their argument is likely to lack substance

How Banks Create Money When Purchasing Assets

I have previously written about the unique legal powers given to commercial banks and credit institutions in general, that allow them to create new currency, thus increasing its supply. For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank’s counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled "when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money": 
https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html 

I received a question about it via e-mail, so I’m writing a follow-up with clarifications.

The flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let’s assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let’s forget about US government bonds for now, let’s say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ≈$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let’s also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)

Let’s say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn’t exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else’s account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created “out of thin air”, and that money was credited into your account. I say “credited” because it’s from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.

Now, I referred to “money in circulation”, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn’t touch the broader economy directly.

If instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.

In the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of “new money” - the money moves within the central bank’s reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank’s reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  

The following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1

silver and gold move differently, which why I generally refrain from referring to these commodities in conjunction, even though a lot of what I write about gold also applies to silver

both, gold and silver are currently great investments, but they exhibit a different risk profile

silver is a lot more volatile, meaning its moves are amplified in both directions

if you’re planning to hold in the treasury/balance sheet it can play a big difference, as you’ll generally be less liquid with your silver holdings - in the sense that you may find it in a significant pullback from a previous high if you try to liquidate it ad-hoc, especially short-term

expect silver to correct down by ≈18%

if the correction starts at the current level, that would bring the price down to ≈$36.22

gold moves up by ≈13% on breakouts, thus ≈$4000/oz gold in November 2025

this means that the current move would bring the gold price up to ≈$3978, which should happen at the start of November, around November 4th 2025

so far, gold has completed ≈6% of the current move - which means there's another ≈7% to move up from the current gold price of ≈$3715

this makes ≈$4000 the top of the next consolidation range. once that price is approached - expect a larger pullback, and potentially a longer consolidation phase, which could last ≈90 days. this means that after the top of the current move is hit (≈$4000) you may have to wait for another ≈3 months before a new all time high

it's important to note that the top of the target range is close to $4000, so gold may not cross $4K before the aforementioned pullback. this means that it may take gold another 4 months before gold firmly sits over $4000/oz

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2025-09-22 20:01

silver's current move is already up >25%. it's better to have a pullback somewhere around the current level

it can move up even further, extending the total move to ≈60%, but then you’ll get a larger and longer lasting pull back

when silver moves in smaller increments, it has shorter-lasting consolidations/pullbacks. so this is what i mean by "better"

US government's intervention into the private sector like with NVIDIA and Intel is negative for US equities long-term

lower interest rates means less attractive repo and deposit rates, thus expect more capital movement into assets, as the yields on MMF/deposits become less attractive

overall positive pressure on asset prices

for the next 3 years - gold, silver  and real estate (real estate is more region specific) are great assets to hold

i'd be wary of US equities

while it's not the top yet and they'll still move higher - you need to be on the lookout the cycle top, which will manifest in some form in the medium long-term

in the next two years it's reasonable to expect a significant downturn in US equities, which may or may not be longer-lasting. it largely depends on the specific QE & other government policies taken to modulate liquidity and yields

so if you're heavily exposed to US equities, it's a good idea to monitor it closely, as there's a risk of a significant downturn

the biggest downside risk to US equities comes from FX, namely from the value and dominance of the US dollar:

➖ while a weaker USD is positive for cross-border USD credit/liquidity, it also makes imports more expensive for the US - and US is a net importer. increased import prices will put negative pressure on the whole economy, including publicly-traded companies

➖ less dominance/demand of USD will not only lead to less total USD abroad available to invest into the US equities, but also lead to the further development of non-USD financial markets because the capital that moves away from USD will need to get invested somewhere. China is the most obvious candidate to benefit from these developments, especially when it comes to equities and renminbi demand. i believe the EU is in a unique position to attract a lot of that USD-exiling demand, but that would require opening-up the markets and regulatory adaptations in that direction

$4000/oz gold by the end of 2025? yes, very much possible, but also beware of consolidation ranges which may extend for months

the remaining ≈50bps of rate cuts this year are very much in the process of being priced-in

moreover the USD isn't likely to strengthen significantly over the next 3 months

and additional liquidity will be injected from US, China, EU, Japan & others

all positive price pressure on gold

the question isn't wether gold will hit $4000 (it will!), but wether it will reach that price in the next 3 months. it could also settle in a consolidation range with the top just below $4K

remember that December is the tax year end pretty much worldwide, so balance sheets will be re-organized. US Treasury will also be running auctions on notes and bills every month until the end of 2025. and that collateral is needed by the wholesale debt markets/money market funds, so it will be bought up. these two could put downward pressure on the price of gold within the next 3 months

within the next 8 months gold will almost certainly reach $4000. so if it doesn't happen by December 31st 2025, it will be soon after

i'we written out my gold price thesis extensively in my previous posts, and closely followed the previous consolidation. you can read that to understand how to interpret data from price pressure, global liquidity and technical analysis standpoint

i will eventually cover these points in more detail, so stay tuned to future posts

this is why duration matching is key for financial institutions

this is also the reason why it's generally not a good idea for governments to refinance long-term debt with short-term debt

this shortens the duration of both - government liabilities and market's assets

┌─ duration matching protects:
│ 
│ ➖ liquidity via cashflow modulation, by helping liability cashflows match asset cashflows
│ 
│ ➖ solvency via asset and liability value modulation, by reducing asset value loss when yields fall and reducing liability value loss when yields raise

🇷🇺 Russian 3Y bond yield is down ≈20% over the last 3 months 😳

of course - this isn't a surprise to you if you've been following my posts. i wrote extensively about this

the biggest reason behind the sharp drop today is the recent 200bp key interest rate cut down to 18%

balance sheet capacity is defined by regulations

in a world dominated by debt refinancing rather than new credit issuance - the ability to take on more assets and liabilities is more important than interest rates

🏦 under Basel III  gold is subject additional funding requirements

there's a 85% required stable funding (RSF) factor on gold under net stable funding ratio (NSFR)

so for every $1B of gold that a bank holds - $850M must be funded with longer term retail or wholesale funding

volatility is at best - a part of a the risk

an increase in volatility doesn't necessarily mean an increase in risk

e.g.:
shortages in global liquidity put mismatched liabilities at a loss. safe assets raise in price

UN's Model Double Taxation Convention has a clear key benefit over OCED's

since UN's model gives more taxing rights for the source state - it's the one that makes sense for developing economies

imagine a developed nation benefiting from cheaper labor in the source state - who created the workforce in the first place, and having their tax base eroded in favor of resident state

so the resident state would get double benefit:

1️⃣ cheaper labor
2️⃣ higher tax income for the government 

on the other hand you could argue for OCED's model favoring a higher volume of investment, thus effectively distributing more wages throughout the economy. this channels the funds more directly to the consumers, which would end up increasing their purchasing power more than if it had to go through the government first

but then again, you must remember the global market is NOT a free market economy. existing legislation overall favors more developed countries, so protective measures for developing countries in the international tax law may make a lot of sense

🇷🇺 Russian Bond Yield Curve Is Inverted

An inverted yield curve is usually a bad sign (e.g. recession)

If you think you understand futures contracts, you must learn bond futures

Besides some differences, like dynamic settlement price, you will quickly realize how much #DeFi improves over #TradFi

📚 Learning how derivatives are priced will make you realize that all the models are based on financing with an interest rate (IR). Future value of a derivative is discounted with an IR.

Where does this extra money come from? 

🔎 Hint: 
you may see it manifest as #inflation 😉

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2024-06-10 12:08

Forward rates compute the borrowing cost of money for a future period. They're derived from the existing interest rates in the market. Useful to compare investments, arbitrage on lend/borrow positions and even predict future inflation value

Here's the concept visualized 👇

⏰ 2024-06-07 10:18

And the first rate cut comes from the European Central Bank (#ECB)

Federal Reserve (#FED) coming up next

A few days ago I tweeted about how a rate cut is imminent, as suggested by the Treasury Bond rates falling below the overnight exchange rate👇

Reaaaaady. Let's go hardfork

⏰ 2024-06-03 20:59

Besides inflation there is also discounting, which measures the time value of money

Discounting states that money today is worth more than tomorrow, since it can be invested to earn an interest

You can compute today's value of future money using the formula below 👇

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2024-06-02 23:03

🔴 Every time the Treasury Bond rate (#DGS10 / #US10Y) raises above the Fed Funds Rate (#FEDFUNDS / #EFFR), the Fed Funds Rate decreases dramatically

Historically, this has always been the case
and this is exactly what's happening now

Expect a rate cut from the #FED very soon

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2024-06-02 16:19

Treasury rates (Treasury Bills & Bonds) are risk-free, but they do not represent the risk-free rate, as they have artificial incentives. The risk-free rate must represent the true cost of borrowing money. Overnight exchange rates are a much better measure of the risk-free rate. http

💡Markets are very easy to predict, you just have to listen at what they're saying

Always remember: #DeFi on-chain data is your friend

🚨📈 FIRST INDICATION OF #CRYPTO DOWNTREND

$ETH supply APY at 3% on #AAVE, the highest value this month

🩳The market is starting to short $ETH

💡REMINDER: Unfollow everyone saying that #Bitcoin is in a #BullMarket, as they have no idea what they are talking about

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-13 17:57

🚨📈A bounce back into the upper part of the previous weekly rectangle is NOT a #BulMarket signal

#Bitcoin will fall back down. So will the rest of the #crypto. Lower than previously

Prepare your #shorts

🚀 #Bitcoin #BullMarket CONFIRMED 

🚨 You MUST unfollow every single person saying that Bitcoin and #crypto entered a bull market, because they have no idea what they are talking about

➡️I challenge anyone to show me a single sign of reversal. There is none #TA

🚨📈 The failure and the bailout of $SVB and $SIVB has shifted the market's sentiment towards the #FED Funds Rate

A rate hike now seems less likely

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-13 04:12

🚨 Despite the Goldman Sachs's statement regarding rate hikes and bank bailouts, currently the market is fully expecting a rate hike by 25bps

Although things may change, specially with the Biden's speech

In either case, QE is not yet back, so no bull market for #Bitcoin

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-12 20:32

Failing banks will tank price of #Bitcoin down with them, because most of money in Bitcoin are loans from those same banks

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-12 19:28

🚨 $PAXG is trading at an $80 premium over $GOLD

The market sentiment is clear: there is a run from #crypto into #gold

Selling your cryptocurrency for $PAXG is a good hedge against both, #Bitcoin and $USD

You can always buy it back for a profit after

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-12 15:54

🚨📈Bank failures will NOT drive $BTC price up

Most of crypto is financed by DEBT

As banks like SVB are failing, both the stock market and crypto prices will fall on Monday 

How to profit:
1️⃣ Short #crypto
2️⃣ Buy #gold
3️⃣ Swap crypto for gold

🚨📈 $USDT APY on #AAVE is 60%

This means that people are shorting $USDT. The  market sentiment is that $USDT is overpriced.

How to profit:
1. Short $USDT
2. Lend $USDT for a high APR. Should last until Monday
3. Do both

This happened because of the depeg of $USDC

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 04:02

🚨📈 $USDT liquidity on #DEX pools decreased to almost ZERO, while $USDC liquidity almost doubled

This is a result of mass swapping of $USDC for $USDT

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 03:48

🚨🔥 Over $1.5 billion $USDC have been burned in the last 8 hours

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:58

🚨📈 $USDC is the 2nd smart contract with the most gas usage on #Ethereum, second only to #Uniswap

$USDT is 4th,  since massive swapping from $USDC to $USDT is taking across all pools in #DEX 

Depegging of $USDC can lead to the collapse of other #stablecoins and #crypto prices

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:33

🚨📈 $USDT reserves are depleting across all #DEX pools that have $USDC. 

It's not just the #3pool on #Curve, #SUSD pool is in the same situation.

This is a result of massive liquidation of $USDC, due to SVB's collapse.

The depegging seems to be more likely by the minute 😳

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:26

🚨📈 $USDT reserves at the $USDC / $USDT 0.01% pool on #Uniswap are depleted 😳

This indicates a massive $USDC liquidation. 

A lot of news saying that $USDC is safe despite #SVB collapse, but the market seems be saying otherwise…

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:14

🚨📈 $USDT reserves at #Curve's #3pool dropped below 3%!!

This is the reason why $BUSD is trading below $USDT at #Binance 

It's caused by mass swap of $USDC to $USDT across the DEXes. Same happening on #Uniswap

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:02

🚨📈 Mass $USDC to $USDT swapping has caused $BUSD to fall below $USDT by more than 1%

As $USDT reserves across #DEX are depleting, it's also affecting #CEX like #Binance 

This is a result of the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank, where $USDC has reserves

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 01:47

🚨 $USDT reserves at #Curve are almost depleted, with less than 4% of it remaining in the #3pool

This is another sign of massive swapping of $USDC for $USDT, due to the collapse of #SVB

$USDC depegging is on the horizon!

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 01:23

🚨 $USDC trading below $USD and $USDT above $USD

Looks like everyone is swapping $USDC for $USDT because of #SVB collapse

Saying that Silvergate represents crypto is like saying that you represent the US Dollar, because you have them in your wallet.

Not a single DEX collapsed for the same reasons. DeFi is building the best financial system in history.

Navigating the world of DeFi without a deep understanding of the economic and monetary theory is akin to navigating an unknown city without a map. Just because the buildings are made of the same material as in your hometown, doesn't mean you'll find your way through #DeFi #crypto
