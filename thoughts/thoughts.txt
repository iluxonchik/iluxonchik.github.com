UN’s Model Double Taxation Convention has a clear key benefit over OCED’s

since UN’s model gives more taxing rights for the source state - it’s the one that makes sense for developing economies

imagine a developed nation benefiting from cheaper labor in the source state - who created the workforce in the first place, and having their tax base eroded in favor of resident state

so the resident state would get double benefit:

1️⃣ cheaper labor
2️⃣ higher tax income for the government 

on the other hand you could argue for OCED’s model favoring a higher volume of investment, thus effectively distributing more wages throughout the economy. this channels the funds more directly to the consumers, which would end up increasing their purchasing power more than if it had to go through the government first

but then again, you must remember the global market is NOT a free market economy. existing legislation overall favors more developed countries, so protective measures for developing countries in the international tax law may make a lot of sense

🇺🇸 Cancelled tariffs means refunds, which means a larger budget deficit

Rising bond yields means that deficit is (even) more expensive to refinance

🇷🇺 Russian Bond Yield Curve Is Inverted

An inverted yield curve is usually a bad sign (e.g. recession)

However, 🇷🇺's fundamentals are healthy

Here's why bond yields skyrocketing worldwide ⬇️

Countries own a lot of US debt (bonds)
Moody's downgraded the US credit rating

Now, countries are at a higher risk of default, because the US debt they own is now less valuable = higher chance of country's default

(simplified)

It’s easy to blame it on the devs or the ecosystem. A fair assessment compares solutions within the ecosystem. Good, innovate and disruptive solutions? Likely a dev issue. If not - the ecosystem. Remember to take the critical mass into consideration

In product, it’s not about doing something or avoiding something. It’s about doing what increases value, and not doing what diminishes value

Very interesting to see the #BitcoinEFT used as a liquidity exit

And only a few days ago the supply APY on most FIAT stable coins was over 20% on #AAVE You could mistake this for a bullish sign, in an apparent short of FIAT for #crypto

Always analyze the big picture

A good software engineer follows the best practices. A great software engineer follows the best practices which are compatible with the goal, the mission, and the vision. In practice this makes suboptimal architecture acceptable in exchange for flexibility.

The point of software is to be able to iterate fast. 100% of software can be replaced with hardware, but nobody wants to hardcode circuits (except for the #ZK crowd 😄). Iteration is its value proposition

This is why software products that take years to deliver don’t make sense

🟢 The first battery of tests has just been launched!

🔵 Authenticated metadata commitments are coming too. This will allow for a cryptographic association between metadata and the geolocation

🟣 Such features are infeasible without the recursive zkSNARK architecture of $MINA

#DeFi only makes sense with private data. This is infeasible on Ethereum, but trivial on $MINA.

Zero-Knowledge will lead to mass adoption of #DeFi, enabling its Cambrian explosion.

Of course, you can also bridge $MINA to Ethereum. This is by design. 

Big things are coming.

If you only understood how cheap $GOLD is now. To put it in perspective, its current FIAT price only reflects inflation prior to 2011 🤯

🚨📈 #Crypto DOWN‼️

Exactly as I pointed out yesterday

💡Markets are very easy to predict, you just have to listen at what they’re saying

Always remember: #DeFi on-chain data is your friend

⏰ 2023-03-15 00:56

🚨📈 FIRST INDICATION OF #CRYPTO DOWNTREND

$ETH supply APY at 3% on #AAVE, the highest value this month

🩳The market is starting to short $ETH

💡REMINDER: Unfollow everyone saying that #Bitcoin is in a #BullMarket, as they have no idea what they are talking about

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-13 17:57

🚨📈A bounce back into the upper part of the previous weekly rectangle is NOT a #BulMarket signal

#Bitcoin will fall back down. So will the rest of the #crypto. Lower than previously

Prepare your #shorts

⏰ 2023-03-13 17:47

🚀 #Bitcoin #BullMarket CONFIRMED 

🚨 You MUST unfollow every single person saying that Bitcoin and #crypto entered a bull market, because they have no idea what they are talking about

➡️I challenge anyone to show me a single sign of reversal. There is none #TA

🚨📈 The failure and the bailout of $SVB and $SIVB has shifted the market's sentiment towards the #FED Funds Rate

A rate hike now seems less likely

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-13 04:12

🚨 Despite the Goldman Sachs's statement regarding rate hikes and bank bailouts, currently the market is fully expecting a rate hike by 25bps

Although things may change, specially with the Biden's speech

In either case, QE is not yet back, so no bull market for #Bitcoin

🚨 $PAXG is trading at an $80 premium over $GOLD

The market sentiment is clear: there is a run from #crypto into #gold

Selling your cryptocurrency for $PAXG is a good hedge against both, #Bitcoin and $USD

You can always buy it back for a profit after

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-12 15:54

🚨📈Bank failures will NOT drive $BTC price up

Most of crypto is financed by DEBT

As banks like SVB are failing, both the stock market and crypto prices will fall on Monday 

How to profit:
1️⃣ Short #crypto
2️⃣ Buy #gold
3️⃣ Swap crypto for gold

⏰ 2023-03-12 04:13

🚨📈 $USDT APY on #AAVE is 60%

This means that people are shorting $USDT. The  market sentiment is that $USDT is overpriced.

How to profit:
1. Short $USDT
2. Lend $USDT for a high APR. Should last until Monday
3. Do both

This happened because of the depeg of $USDC

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 04:02

🚨📈 $USDT liquidity on #DEX pools decreased to almost ZERO, while $USDC liquidity almost doubled

This is a result of mass swapping of $USDC for $USDT

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 03:48

🚨🔥 Over $1.5 billion $USDC have been burned in the last 8 hours

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:58

🚨📈 $USDC is the 2nd smart contract with the most gas usage on #Ethereum, second only to #Uniswap

$USDT is 4th,  since massive swapping from $USDC to $USDT is taking across all pools in #DEX 

Depegging of $USDC can lead to the collapse of other #stablecoins and #crypto prices

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:33

🚨📈 $USDT reserves are depleting across all #DEX pools that have $USDC. 

It’s not just the #3pool on #Curve, #SUSD pool is in the same situation.

This is a result of massive liquidation of $USDC, due to SVB's collapse.

The depegging seems to be more likely by the minute 😳

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:26

🚨📈 $USDT reserves at the $USDC / $USDT 0.01% pool on #Uniswap are depleted 😳

This indicates a massive $USDC liquidation. 

A lot of news saying that $USDC is safe despite #SVB collapse, but the market seems be saying otherwise…

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:14

🚨📈 $USDT reserves at #Curve's #3pool dropped below 3%!!

This is the reason why $BUSD is trading below $USDT at #Binance 

It’s caused by mass swap of $USDC to $USDT across the DEXes. Same happening on #Uniswap

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 02:02

🚨📈 Mass $USDC to $USDT swapping has caused $BUSD to fall below $USDT by more than 1%

As $USDT reserves across #DEX are depleting, it’s also affecting #CEX like #Binance 

This is a result of the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank, where $USDC has reserves

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 01:47

🚨 $USDT reserves at #Curve are almost depleted, with less than 4% of it remaining in the #3pool

This is another sign of massive swapping of $USDC for $USDT, due to the collapse of #SVB

$USDC depegging is on the horizon!

~ ✨ ~

⏰ 2023-03-11 01:23

🚨 $USDC trading below $USD and $USDT above $USD

Looks like everyone is swapping $USDC for $USDT because of #SVB collapse
