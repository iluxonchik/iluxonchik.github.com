Once funding becomes unavailable (i.e. market isn't willing to lend at favorable interest rates), funding must come from asset liquidation (i.e. the sale of Bitcoin).\n\nThe availability of funding is mostly dependent on Bitcoin's price. As long as Bitcoin price and trend is favorable around the dates when the debt wall matures - MSTR should be able to continue their leveraged trade. MSTR share price vs Bitcoin NAV is also important. If MSTR trades a premium over Bitcoin's NAV it allows Microstrategy to short their own equity and long Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, an unfavorable Bitcoin price action environment (e.g. during a bear market) that coincides with debt repayment obligations may trigger the unwinding of this leveraged position, forcing MSTR to sell Bitcoin, thus putting further downwards price pressure on Bitcoin, which lowers Microstrategy's equity even more, which makes lender even less likely to lend. The end result is an even more degraded funding capacity, which at the limit leads to bankruptcy.\n\nDebt starts maturing from 2028 (≈$1B), but the most significant portion of ≈70%/$5.8B matures in 2029-2030.

Judging by the actions of the sovereigns positioning their local monetary units for reserve currency position that is highly unlikely 😁\n\nMore specifically, China & BRICS are heavily buying gold, and they have openly discussed partly gold-backed currencies several times. In the EU, the ECB is very clear on their stance against adding Bitcoin to their reserves.\n\nBitcoin doesn't exhibit the characteristics necessary for a reserve currency. If you believe that it does, then you need to start by explaining how it would integrate into the current financial system. Do not forget to consider Central Banks, wholesale debt markets and refinancing cycles. A potential role that Bitcoin may take is as collateral, for example in money markets. The problem is, that you will be inadvertently running into very large haircuts and low LTVs. So unless Bitcoin concisely keeps yielding higher highs, you'd be better off by using higher-quality collateral, such as government bonds or even equities.\n\nAnother point comes down to risk. The more Bitcoin is used the more risky it becomes. Sure, you can say that the network also growth with usage, but in case Central Banks start holding Bitcoin - it becomes a geopolitical liability. It will become a matter of time before disruptive attack and compromise of private keys. Also, >90% of the buy volume of Bitcoin is in USD or its derivatives, such as USD-pegged stablecoins. So it's USD that's mostly invested there, not euros, renminbi or others. This makes Bitcoin extremely exposed to USD currency risk.\n\nGold and silver have a much more modest exposure to the risks above. You don’t have to believe me - just look at the history.

Gold doesn't need Bitcoin", "articleBody": "Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.\n\nBitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. \n\nWhile gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.\n\nGold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.\n\nElectronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. \n\nDigital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them\n\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin", "datePublished": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.jpg"}]}

        <p>Proxy Model From Polymarket&#x27;s 15 Minute Bitcoin Price<br><br>I found historical datasets for Polymarket&#x27;s 15 minute up or down Bitcoin price and I think I can use this data to obtain useful signals via a proxy model. I&#x27;ll start with linear regression to build a prediction model, to see if this transfer learning approach works here.<br><br>Yes, it will be overfitting, but for this signal generator it would be by design. The end goal is to find features that improve the random forest&#x27;s split rules, thus further improving the win rate.</p>

        <p>Scarcity Doesn&#x27;t Make Bitcoin Better Than Gold <br><br>Just because something is more scarce, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s more valuable. The number of existing Picasso paintings is much more scarce than Bitcoin - and that number won&#x27;t increase. <br><br>Would you rather have all of Picasso&#x27;s paintings or all of the Bitcoin? Or maybe that&#x27;s a bad example. If you own all of the Bitcoin, it&#x27;s a big question what will the other market participants value it at -- definitely much below the current prices though.  <br><br>There&#x27;s a lot more than you can do with gold than with Bitcoin. In fact, the nodes supporting Bitcoin network use gold in their connectors. Not to mention that you can take down Bitcoin, but you can&#x27;t take down gold (just cut electricity and/or node subnets).  <br><br>Moreover, saying that gold is &quot;infinite&quot; is wrong technically and practically. There is a big distinction in the amount of gold existent in the universe and Planet Earth, and the amount of gold that&#x27;s economically viable to obtain.<br><br>If your argument on why Bitcoin is better than gold relies heavily on the scarcity aspect - it&#x27;s probably a weak argument.</p>

        <p>Strategy Invents Financial Metrics And Everybody Applauds 👏<br><br>MSTR&#x27;s own website states that their reports do not reflect the financial reality:<br><br>&quot;None of BTC Rating, BTC Credit, or BTC Risk are measures of financial results or liquidity, or key performance indicators.&quot;<br><br>Strategy&#x27;s software business also operates at a ≈$60M loss, but on their website and socials they decide to ignore a part of expenses and market it as profit. So they create their own non-standard accounting and credit metrics and advertise those.<br><br>Strategy has a consistent pattern of misrepresenting their financials to look more favorable in their public marketing campaigns. A lot of it is in the form of Michael Saylor&#x27;s videos, podcast appearances and posts on X. A lot seem to think that just because someone says something in a video or a social media post it must be true. <br><br>Words can be deceiving, numbers not so much.</p>

        <p>MicroStrategy Is Dependent On Refinancing Capacity, Not Bitcoin Price<br><br>MSTR won&#x27;t have to sell Bitcoin if BTC price goes down, they&#x27;ll have to sell Bitcoin if they&#x27;re unable to acquire funding along the maturity of their debt wall. <br><br>MicroStrategy is essentially a leveraged trade on Bitcoin, based on the following cycle:<br><br>1️⃣ Acquire funding via debt or equity<br>2️⃣ Buy Bitcoin<br>3️⃣ Repeat<br><br>This cycle works for as long as MSTR is able to obtain funding. Once funding becomes unavailable (i.e. market isn&#x27;t willing to lend at favorable interest rates), funding must come from asset liquidation (i.e. the sale of Bitcoin).<br><br>The availability of funding is mostly dependent on Bitcoin&#x27;s price. As long as Bitcoin price and trend is favorable around the dates when the debt wall matures - MSTR should be able to continue their leveraged trade. MSTR share price vs Bitcoin NAV is also important. If MSTR trades a premium over Bitcoin&#x27;s NAV it allows Microstrategy to short their own equity and long Bitcoin.<br><br>However, an unfavorable Bitcoin price action environment (e.g. during a bear market) that coincides with debt repayment obligations may trigger the unwinding of this leveraged position, forcing MSTR to sell Bitcoin, thus putting further downwards price pressure on Bitcoin, which lowers Microstrategy&#x27;s equity even more, which makes lender even less likely to lend. The end result is an even more degraded funding capacity, which at the limit leads to bankruptcy.<br><br>Debt starts maturing from 2028 (≈$1B), but the most significant portion of ≈70%/$5.8B matures in 2029-2030. This is where the price of Bitcoin is of great importance for Microstrategy&#x27;s solvency.<br><br>So don&#x27;t expect Microstrategy to have pressure to sell significant amounts of Bitcoin before at least 2027, even if the Bitcoin price stays low.</p>

        <p>Why would a Central Bank hold Bitcoin in reserves?<br><br>1. Even assuming that Bitcoin is an inflation hedge - it still doesn&#x27;t mean that Central Banks should hold it. What would be the purpose of that? Central Banks are not commercial institutions - they hold assets for very specific reasons (e.g. FX rate stabilization).<br><br>2. You may have misunderstood me. I said that Bitcoin isn&#x27;t money - but that by itself doesn&#x27;t mean that Central Banks shouldn&#x27;t hold it. FIAT currencies aren&#x27;t money either. Neither are government bonds. BUT - those bonds or currencies generally don&#x27;t crash &gt;50% on cycle tops. So it&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s not money, combined with the other points I mentioned here and in the article that i linked<br><br>3. Kaspa isn&#x27;t money. It certainly hasn&#x27;t been long enough to be classified as money, nor it has enough intrinsic value. It carries the same set of technology risks as other cryptocurrencies- and even without looking at the chart - I can tell you that it&#x27;s correlated to the rest of the crypto market. <br><br>I am a big fan of crypto, but we need to keep it real 😄<br><br>Thousands of accounts on X with large following shill Bitcoin/Crypto non-stop, with little reasoning behind it. They either do it for pay, engagement or a mix of both.<br><br>You don&#x27;t have to look far - usually just search for &quot;gold&quot; on their profile and you&#x27;ll find something like this (see screenshot).<br><br>If you want to understand how Bitcoin is not gold, it will never be gold, and it will never replace gold - read this article: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html</a></p>

        <p>All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards<br><br>And some still think that Bitcoin will be the next reserve currency. Judging by the actions of the sovereigns positioning their local monetary units for reserve currency position that is highly unlikely 😁<br><br>More specifically, China &amp; BRICS are heavily buying gold, and they have openly discussed partly gold-backed currencies several times. In the EU, the ECB is very clear on their stance against adding Bitcoin to their reserves.<br><br>Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t exhibit the characteristics necessary for a reserve currency. If you believe that it does, then you need to start by explaining how it would integrate into the current financial system. Do not forget to consider Central Banks, wholesale debt markets and refinancing cycles. A potential role that Bitcoin may take is as collateral, for example in money markets. The problem is, that you will be inadvertently running into very large haircuts and low LTVs. So unless Bitcoin concisely keeps yielding higher highs, you&#x27;d be better off by using higher-quality collateral, such as government bonds or even equities.<br><br>Another point comes down to risk. The more Bitcoin is used the more risky it becomes. Sure, you can say that the network also growth with usage, but in case Central Banks start holding Bitcoin - it becomes a geopolitical liability. It will become a matter of time before disruptive attack and compromise of private keys. Also, &gt;90% of the buy volume of Bitcoin is in USD or its derivatives, such as USD-pegged stablecoins. So it&#x27;s USD that&#x27;s mostly invested there, not euros, renminbi or others. This makes Bitcoin extremely exposed to USD currency risk.<br><br>Gold and silver have a much more modest exposure to the risks above. You don’t have to believe me - just look at the history. Since 500 BCE it&#x27;s mostly been gold and/or silver - and Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t change that.<br><br>Accounts on X that relentlessly promote the idea of Bitcoin being money, and better money than gold fail to address these points.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn&#x27;t need Bitcoin<br><br>TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.<br><br>Bitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. <br><br>While gold isn&#x27;t strictly required for electronics, it&#x27;s widely used to due to organic demand. Gold&#x27;s ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold&#x27;s intrinsic value.<br><br>Gold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.<br><br>Electronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won&#x27;t be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. <br><br>Digital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn&#x27;t have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them<br><br>This is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition</p>
