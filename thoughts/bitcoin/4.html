BTC crowd seems very obsessed about gold - especially when it comes to showing how it's inferior to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not gold - and it will never be gold - they're very different assets. that doesn't mean that BTC ownership is a bad idea - but it's important important to approach it rationally \n\na large part of this seems coordinated/paid campaigns. liquidity always needs an exit\n\nso Bitcoin should continue with some more downside in the near future\n\n* this sentiment is based on vibes, but it's backed by technicals & fundamentals at its base. you can find in-depth explanations in my past posts and threads", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/my-vibe-meter-on-bitcoin-is-off-the-charts", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/my-vibe-meter-on-bitcoin-is-off-the-charts", "datePublished": "2025-10-19T13:12:43+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-19T13:12:43+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/my-vibe-meter-on-bitcoin-is-off-the-charts.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "sell your gold and buy Bitcoin", "articleBody": "sell your gold and buy Bitcoin\n\ndealers/market makers need exit liquidity\n\ncentral banks need a lower purchase price\n\nyou've been warned! 😄", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/sell-your-gold-and-buy-bitcoin", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/sell-your-gold-and-buy-bitcoin", "datePublished": "2025-10-18T13:30:05+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-18T13:30:05+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/sell-your-gold-and-buy-bitcoin.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "BTC went from $0.004 to $110,000 USD in 16 years, but gold was never this cheap in over 5000 years", "articleBody": "BTC went from $0.004 to $110,000 USD in 16 years, but gold was never this cheap in over 5000 years\n\nGoing back to the start of recorded price systems - gold's starting price per gram is ≈100 days of labor! This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago\n\nSo using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today's USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it's useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold's USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.\n\nWill Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form. Gold (Au) hasn't changed in 13 billion years\n\nBitcoin promo accounts love to compare BTC to gold, and they frequently cite that BTC is up much more than gold over the last 16 years. The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent\n\nWhat the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived. As such, such comparisons fail short\n\nThey also seem to selectively omit the massive volatility - gold doesn't go down 80% every other day/cycle top\n\nThe gold prices here I computed are estimates - don't take them as hard quantitive data. Read this in the context of comparing the price of gold and Bitcoin. If someone's argument is that Bitcoin is better than gold because it had a higher percentual return in 16 years - it likely lacks substance", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/btc-went-from-0-004-to-110-000-usd-in-16-years-but-gold-was", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/btc-went-from-0-004-to-110-000-usd-in-16-years-but-gold-was", "datePublished": "2025-10-18T12:28:03+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-18T12:28:03+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/btc-went-from-0-004-to-110-000-usd-in-16-years-but-gold-was.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "1.

Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which would make central-bank issued currency more volatile - this goes exactly against the direct mandate of most central banks - price stability.\n\na more volatile currency will also lead to a more volatile bond market, which will make government funding more volatile, and thus a high risk/uncertain economy\n\nand i'm not even going to touch on the security risks. okay, maybe briefly 😄:\n\n➖ governments are one of the only entities that can realistically perform a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin. well, with central banks owning BTC will make such attacks much more attractive -

        <p>my vibe meter on Bitcoin is off the charts 📈*<br><br>the algorithm on X has been pushing a lot of pro-BTC content over the past month, and it&#x27;s becoming more and more irrational: <br><br>accounts with millions of followers recycling 2024 news about &quot;new&quot; gold reserves in China, false news about China legalizing Bitcoin and calls for gold going down to $2000<br><br>every pro-Bitcoin account seems to be calling a long-term gold top (LOL!) and heavy rotation into Bitcoin. actually a lot of BTC shill content is about BTC being better than gold - and the arguments for it aren&#x27;t very sound. i&#x27;ve written several posts explaining this. BTC crowd seems very obsessed about gold - especially when it comes to showing how it&#x27;s inferior to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not gold - and it will never be gold - they&#x27;re very different assets. that doesn&#x27;t mean that BTC ownership is a bad idea - but it&#x27;s important important to approach it rationally <br><br>a large part of this seems coordinated/paid campaigns. liquidity always needs an exit<br><br>so Bitcoin should continue with some more downside in the near future<br><br>* this sentiment is based on vibes, but it&#x27;s backed by technicals &amp; fundamentals at its base. you can find in-depth explanations in my past posts and threads</p>

        <p>BTC went from $0.004 to $110,000 USD in 16 years, but gold was never this cheap in over 5000 years<br><br>Going back to the start of recorded price systems - gold&#x27;s starting price per gram is ≈100 days of labor! This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago<br><br>So using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today&#x27;s USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it&#x27;s useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold&#x27;s USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.<br><br>Will Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form. Gold (Au) hasn&#x27;t changed in 13 billion years<br><br>Bitcoin promo accounts love to compare BTC to gold, and they frequently cite that BTC is up much more than gold over the last 16 years. The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent<br><br>What the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived. As such, such comparisons fail short<br><br>They also seem to selectively omit the massive volatility - gold doesn&#x27;t go down 80% every other day/cycle top<br><br>The gold prices here I computed are estimates - don&#x27;t take them as hard quantitive data. Read this in the context of comparing the price of gold and Bitcoin. If someone&#x27;s argument is that Bitcoin is better than gold because it had a higher percentual return in 16 years - it likely lacks substance</p>

        <p>central banks have rejected holding Bitcoin in their reserves including Fed, ECB, PBoC and many others<br><br>what would even be the purpose of a central bank holding BTC on their balance sheet? so that they can stabilize the value of the currency against Bitcoin? what would be the practical benefit from it now?<br><br>cross-border crypto trade in non-stablecoins is negligible. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which would make central-bank issued currency more volatile - this goes exactly against the direct mandate of most central banks - price stability.<br><br>a more volatile currency will also lead to a more volatile bond market, which will make government funding more volatile, and thus a high risk/uncertain economy<br><br>and i&#x27;m not even going to touch on the security risks. okay, maybe briefly 😄:<br><br>➖ governments are one of the only entities that can realistically perform a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin. well, with central banks owning BTC will make such attacks much more attractive - including at the geopolitical level. the same goes for denial of service family of attacks<br><br>➖ what if the central bank&#x27;s wallets get hacked/compromised? i&#x27;m not talking about quantum computers breaking RSA, but operational level mistake or compromise<br><br>so for the next 10 years, I view central banks holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet as a negative sign for their currency. of course, the protocol and the bitcoin network will evolve/change over time, and with so may my stance<br><br>i believe cryptocurrencies, and more specifically distributed layer technologies/blockchain architectures can bring immense value to our financial system as a whole, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should have central banks speculating on that today. it makes much more sense to increase gold reserves instead</p>

        <p>virtually every corporation that accepts Ethereum/Bitcoin for payments doesn&#x27;t actually process the payment in crypto<br><br>they immediately covert it to USD or another FIAT, and not actually hold the BTC, ETH, etc<br><br>the convertion is generally done via an intermediary, so the company you&#x27;re buying never even touch or care about the crypto asset. they want the same government-backed currencies that we use now<br><br>the intermediary will also generally charge a fee, around ≈1% of the transaction value. so buying directly with crypto is likely to be more expensive than directly with FIAT. if you just sell the crypto for FIAT and pay directly in USD, EUR, etc it will likely be cheaper. so what&#x27;s the point of paying more?<br><br>don&#x27;t be fooled by headlines or articles that suggest otherwise</p>
