Among others, the demand for it is dependent on weather and subject to seasonality. This is very intuitive: if it's colder, there is an increased demand for heat (fuels), and natural gas is that fuel. \n\nThe spike in natural gas prices in January 2026 can be explained by the severe cold/snow storms and their effects on supply, demand and storage across the United States and Europe.\n\nBut you don't need to know any of that. All you have to do is open a historical price chart for natural gas.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, natural gas prices increased almost ≈x6.5 in price.

The results from their buy calls from just a few months ago look impressive - price more than doubling isn't uncommon. The keywords here are *isn't uncommon*. A 2x gain in the mining sector since November 2025 isn't impressive. When evaluating the quality of the calls, it's important that you establish the correct baseline.\n\nOne examples of such buy calls was shared by Peter Schiff, who posted his investment suggestion from November 2025 on Nexa Resources S.A. (NYSE: NEXA), which is a miner/producer of zinc, copper, silver and some gold. Since November 2025, its stock price has more than doubled. This was shared as a part of a paid newsletter, whose November 2025 issue was made available to the public. While a >100% price increase may seem impressive, you could've been better off by just investing in a larger, well established miners like Hecla, which are subjects to a smaller set of risks.\n\nSpeaking numbers, you could've achieved a similar x2 gain since November 2025 by acquiring Hecla Mining Company stock (NYSE: HL) instead. Hecla is a well-established gold, silver, zinc and other metals miner with more than 60 years of price action dating back to 1964. In contrast, Nexa's price action dates back only by less than a decade - to 2017.  As such, you can achieve the result at the cost of a smaller risk. I've shared Hecla Mining several times in my lists on my website throughout 2025 at no cost. I probably also shared others, but Hecla is the one that first comes to mind.\n\nHere's what's important to understand:\n\nThere's a global liquidity inflow into the commodities sector, which includes miners, producers & Co equities. The alpha comes from identifying outperformers relative to the index, conditional to risk. Well-established, long running companies generally come with a lower risk profiles, compared to less well established or juniors.\n\nThe question isn't whether you can get more upside gain with smaller cap miners/juniors, the question is whether that extra potential gain justifies the extra risk and cost. Frequently the most obvious choices are the best ones. Investing into several miner/producer indexes, alongside a few individual well established, large-cap picks may be all that you need.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/dont-overthink-commodity-miners-investments.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/dont-overthink-commodity-miners-investments.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-22T11:29:29+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-22T11:29:29+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/2eef21a0-b667-5cfe-82e8-b998ccfabd96.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Copper Is A Great Investment In 2026 - Technicals & Fundamentals Explained", "articleBody": "Copper Is A Great Investment In 2026 - Technicals & Fundamentals Explained\n\n*A big part of this analysis also applies to copper miners, but I prefer to cover that in a separate article\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, copper is currently flipping a ≈20 year old resistance for support. On a monthly chart, copper is in a multi-year upwards channel, and it’s now close to the upper trend line of that channel. Copper is also at record lows when priced in terms of gold and silver.\n\nFrom a fundamental, supply/demand perspective, copper is required for electrification, data centers, new buildings, electric vehicles, and electric appliances in general.\n\nInternational Copper Study Group (ICSG) expects refined copper’s demand to surpass the available supply/production in 2026. Given that new copper mines are slow to build, increasing the supply of copper requires great investments of capital and time, and in case of continued increase of global copper demand, it may take decades for the production to meet that demand fully.\n\nThis creates a setup for a significant upwards price pressure on copper from current levels.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of the metal's general price action. Copper is not gold - copper is significantly more volatile, but post 2021, the volatility has been more compressed to the upwards channel structure described above and shown in the chart.\n\nRegarding the maximum drawdown from the current price levels (≈$5.90/lb), I don’t believe that copper will correct more than ≈15%, as there it will find a strong support area, and soon after the bottom support trend line from the monthly upwards channel, both of which will exert strong buying pressure. Within 6 months from now, I expect copper’s price to be above the current levels. This a risk-adjusted timeframe in which you should frame the current thesis - so it means that, for the same amount of capital, your investments in copper from today will be yield significantly more than they would in at the prevailing rate in money market funds. Realistically, I think it will happen much sooner than 6 months.\n\nIn addition to everything above there is also monetary debasement, debt refinancing walls and negative pressures on USD dominance as a reserve currency.

A capital outflow out of the U.S. dollar creates positive price pressure on gold via increased demand. \n\nThis is true regardless of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on whether President Trump can lawfully impose unilateral broad tariffs via executive order using the the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEAP). \n\nAt the high level, there's two moves for gold here:\n\n➖ If the tariffs are deemed illegal and the collected tariff revenue must to refunded - which would lead to an increase of USD supply accessible to the wider economy. The refund would come either from existing reserves, thus directly increasing broad money or from newly issued debt, which may reduce broad money in the short-term, but the newly issued bonds will eventually be rehypothecated, thus effectively increasing USD credit/effective supply. This is positive price pressure on gold, at the very least due to the increase in liquidity. This is negative price pressure on USD, due to increased supply & public debt of the issuer.\n\n➖If the tariffs are deemed legal, and/or do not need to be refunded, the geopolitical and liquidity risk remains, which materializes in a lower incencitve to own USD. After all, why would you want to hold a currency, whose purchasing power/liqudity may be reduced every other week after the markets close on a Friday? Gold is the natural outflow path from USD, especially at sovereign/central bank level.\n\nIf the Eurozone wants to reduce their USD exposure in the next 5 years, what can they do? The European countries may not want to start significantly increasing the share of renminbi in their FX reserves just yet. Additionally, EU could position Euro as an alternative to USD for settlements, as EUR is already the second most used currency for international trade & FX turnover, second only to USD. Gold presents itself as an attractive alternative to USD, even if the focus on increasing its tonnage in the reserves is transitory. At the very least, increasing the share of gold relative to the balance sheet size in the Eurozone, would increase foreign exchange rate value of Euro and/or would provide basis for monetary expansion in the future.\n\nMany forget that the \"gold and foreign exchange reserves\" are a single asset-side item in central banks balance sheets. \"Gold\" is explicitly discriminated among all other assets/commodities, while all currencies and their derivatives (e.g. sovereign bonds) are clustered under the generic \"FX reserves\" name. Across all currencies, renminbi is best positioned to increase its share in reserve assets and international settlement. Unlike renminbi, gold is nobody's liability and has no counterparty risk (assuming no jurisdiction risk, which can be greatly mitigated by storing the gold bullion domestically).\n\nGiven this, I expect the European countries to increase their gold holdings, via a combination of swaps from USD-denominated assets for gold and other FX currencies like the Chinese Yen.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/good-for-gold-bad-for-usd-us-tariffs-on-europe.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/good-for-gold-bad-for-usd-us-tariffs-on-europe.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-20T14:50:08+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-20T14:50:08+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/7841e1af-42db-5ebf-8415-5a9a1951150b.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Every day it becomes more obvious how US tariffs, unilateral sanctions & multi-faceted geopolitical…", "articleBody": "Every day it becomes more obvious how US tariffs, unilateral sanctions & multi-faceted geopolitical aggression including towards its allies and major trade partners is a strategic mistake\n\nExpect this trend to continue throughout 2026", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/every-day-it-becomes-more-obvious-how-us-tariffs-unilateral.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/every-day-it-becomes-more-obvious-how-us-tariffs-unilateral.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-20T14:22:56+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-20T14:22:56+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b9d24e56-1a7a-59f5-9817-b48ef1647d42.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Yesterday, I explained why silver mining stocks are undervalued in 2026", "articleBody": "Yesterday, I explained why silver mining stocks are undervalued in 2026\n\nToday, silver miners are up almost 6% across major FX currencies 😄\n\nOf course, it's to early to tell whether my thesis is correct, but I'll throw in another prediction: this upward price movement in miners to continue.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/yesterday-i-explained-why-silver-mining-stocks-are.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/yesterday-i-explained-why-silver-mining-stocks-are.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-19T15:57:08+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-19T15:57:08+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/36678b17-2520-57aa-a5fe-05463cbc5017.jpg"}]}

        <p>Palladium Is A Great Investment In 2026<br><br>Palladium already more than doubled since 2025, but its upwards move won&#x27;t stop here, as it&#x27;s setup to appreciate against both, USD and gold.<br><br>As I&#x27;ve previously explained, the current commodities supercycle will lead to a price increase across the whole set of commodities, which includes precious and industrial metals and their miners. Palladium is very well positioned for the next leg of liquidity inflow.<br><br>Against USD, palladium is currently trading at ≈$2075/oz. My 2026 target for Palladium is at least ≈$2500/oz, or up another ≈24% from current price levels. Platinum has recently rebounded from its monthly support line.<br><br>Against gold, palladium is in a similar situation, as its rebounding from a monthly support trend line. The current Palladium/Gold ratio is at ≈0.38. I expect it to rebound upwards to at least ≈0.7, meaning that palladium is setup to appreciate against gold. Even if gold retraces in the short-to-medium term, I don&#x27;t expect that price drop be to neither permanent, nor long-lasting.<br><br>There is also an ongoing deficit of palladium supply relative to its demand.</p>

        <p>Today&#x27;s Commodity Miners Sell-Off Is A Buying Opportunity<br><br>I&#x27;ve made numerous such calls in the past, and they were correct 100% of the time. Today, I&#x27;m making one of such calls again.<br><br>Gold, silver and copper miners are down today, with indices and individual large caps falling by as much as ≈8%, despite the underlying metals remaining in the green. This is exactly the situation where you can leverage the increased volatility in the mining sector to increase your exposure to the underlying metals during an uptrend.<br><br>I expect the prices of gold and silver miners indices to increase by ≈30% from current levels within roughly 10 trading weeks from now. It may happen sooner than though - pay close attention to the price action.<br><br>It&#x27;s also possible for the price to dip lower than the current levels before the upwards move described above materializes. This mainly depends on the price action of the precious and industrial metals in the next few weeks, but I don&#x27;t believe that either one of them has topped for the cycle, thus uptrend resumption is imminent.<br><br>I&#x27;ve written several articles explaining why commodities and commodity miners are a great investment for 2026.

    <div class="thought-content">
        <p>Natural Gas Prices Are Very Volatile<br><br>It&#x27;s normal for natural gas prices to increase or decrease sharply. Among others, the demand for it is dependent on weather and subject to seasonality. This is very intuitive: if it&#x27;s colder, there is an increased demand for heat (fuels), and natural gas is that fuel. <br><br>The spike in natural gas prices in January 2026 can be explained by the severe cold/snow storms and their effects on supply, demand and storage across the United States and Europe.<br><br>But you don&#x27;t need to know any of that. All you have to do is open a historical price chart for natural gas.<br><br>From 2020 to 2022, natural gas prices increased almost ≈x6.5 in price. Then, from 2022 to 2024, the prices fell by ≈84%, bottoming just ≈6% above the 2020 lows.<br><br>Thus, any sources proclaiming that &quot;it is not normal&quot; for NATGas to increase 70% in roughly two weeks, implying that it&#x27;s a signal of a major distress in the system, are unlikely to be a reliable source on this topic.</p>

        <p>Don&#x27;t Overthink Commodity Miners Investments<br><br>I&#x27;m now coming across several large finance accounts on X, which are sharing the results of their miner equity picks from 2025 made available to groups/newsletters/communities with paid access. The results from their buy calls from just a few months ago look impressive - price more than doubling isn&#x27;t uncommon. The keywords here are *isn&#x27;t uncommon*. A 2x gain in the mining sector since November 2025 isn&#x27;t impressive. When evaluating the quality of the calls, it&#x27;s important that you establish the correct baseline.<br><br>One examples of such buy calls was shared by Peter Schiff, who posted his investment suggestion from November 2025 on Nexa Resources S.A. (NYSE: NEXA), which is a miner/producer of zinc, copper, silver and some gold. Since November 2025, its stock price has more than doubled. This was shared as a part of a paid newsletter, whose November 2025 issue was made available to the public. While a &gt;100% price increase may seem impressive, you could&#x27;ve been better off by just investing in a larger, well established miners like Hecla, which are subjects to a smaller set of risks.<br><br>Speaking numbers, you could&#x27;ve achieved a similar x2 gain since November 2025 by acquiring Hecla Mining Company stock (NYSE: HL) instead. Hecla is a well-established gold, silver, zinc and other metals miner with more than 60 years of price action dating back to 1964. In contrast, Nexa&#x27;s price action dates back only by less than a decade - to 2017.  As such, you can achieve the result at the cost of a smaller risk. I&#x27;ve shared Hecla Mining several times in my lists on my website throughout 2025 at no cost. I probably also shared others, but Hecla is the one that first comes to mind.<br><br>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s important to understand:<br><br>There&#x27;s a global liquidity inflow into the commodities sector, which includes miners, producers &amp; Co equities. The alpha comes from identifying outperformers relative to the index, conditional to risk. Well-established, long running companies generally come with a lower risk profiles, compared to less well established or juniors.<br><br>The question isn&#x27;t whether you can get more upside gain with smaller cap miners/juniors, the question is whether that extra potential gain justifies the extra risk and cost. Frequently the most obvious choices are the best ones. Investing into several miner/producer indexes, alongside a few individual well established, large-cap picks may be all that you need.</p>

        <p>Copper Is A Great Investment In 2026 - Technicals &amp; Fundamentals Explained<br><br>*A big part of this analysis also applies to copper miners, but I prefer to cover that in a separate article<br><br>From a technical standpoint, copper is currently flipping a ≈20 year old resistance for support. On a monthly chart, copper is in a multi-year upwards channel, and it’s now close to the upper trend line of that channel. Copper is also at record lows when priced in terms of gold and silver.<br><br>From a fundamental, supply/demand perspective, copper is required for electrification, data centers, new buildings, electric vehicles, and electric appliances in general.<br><br>International Copper Study Group (ICSG) expects refined copper’s demand to surpass the available supply/production in 2026. Given that new copper mines are slow to build, increasing the supply of copper requires great investments of capital and time, and in case of continued increase of global copper demand, it may take decades for the production to meet that demand fully.<br><br>This creates a setup for a significant upwards price pressure on copper from current levels.<br><br>It&#x27;s also important to be aware of the metal&#x27;s general price action. Copper is not gold - copper is significantly more volatile, but post 2021, the volatility has been more compressed to the upwards channel structure described above and shown in the chart.<br><br>Regarding the maximum drawdown from the current price levels (≈$5.90/lb), I don’t believe that copper will correct more than ≈15%, as there it will find a strong support area, and soon after the bottom support trend line from the monthly upwards channel, both of which will exert strong buying pressure. Within 6 months from now, I expect copper’s price to be above the current levels. This a risk-adjusted timeframe in which you should frame the current thesis - so it means that, for the same amount of capital, your investments in copper from today will be yield significantly more than they would in at the prevailing rate in money market funds. Realistically, I think it will happen much sooner than 6 months.<br><br>In addition to everything above there is also monetary debasement, debt refinancing walls and negative pressures on USD dominance as a reserve currency. These 3, alongside the geopolitical tensions present an additional source of positive price pressure on the whole commodity sector. My copper price thesis is positioned within this liquidity flow into commodities. I’ve covered these points in detail in my previous posts.</p>

        <p>Good For Gold, Bad For USD: US Tariffs on Europe<br><br>The tariffs imposed by the U.S. on the European countries are detrimental to USD&#x27;s position as a reserve currency. A capital outflow out of the U.S. dollar creates positive price pressure on gold via increased demand. <br><br>This is true regardless of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision on whether President Trump can lawfully impose unilateral broad tariffs via executive order using the the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEAP). <br><br>At the high level, there&#x27;s two moves for gold here:<br><br>➖ If the tariffs are deemed illegal and the collected tariff revenue must to refunded - which would lead to an increase of USD supply accessible to the wider economy. The refund would come either from existing reserves, thus directly increasing broad money or from newly issued debt, which may reduce broad money in the short-term, but the newly issued bonds will eventually be rehypothecated, thus effectively increasing USD credit/effective supply. This is positive price pressure on gold, at the very least due to the increase in liquidity. This is negative price pressure on USD, due to increased supply &amp; public debt of the issuer.<br><br>➖If the tariffs are deemed legal, and/or do not need to be refunded, the geopolitical and liquidity risk remains, which materializes in a lower incencitve to own USD. After all, why would you want to hold a currency, whose purchasing power/liqudity may be reduced every other week after the markets close on a Friday? Gold is the natural outflow path from USD, especially at sovereign/central bank level.<br><br>If the Eurozone wants to reduce their USD exposure in the next 5 years, what can they do? The European countries may not want to start significantly increasing the share of renminbi in their FX reserves just yet. Additionally, EU could position Euro as an alternative to USD for settlements, as EUR is already the second most used currency for international trade &amp; FX turnover, second only to USD. Gold presents itself as an attractive alternative to USD, even if the focus on increasing its tonnage in the reserves is transitory. At the very least, increasing the share of gold relative to the balance sheet size in the Eurozone, would increase foreign exchange rate value of Euro and/or would provide basis for monetary expansion in the future.<br><br>Many forget that the &quot;gold and foreign exchange reserves&quot; are a single asset-side item in central banks balance sheets. &quot;Gold&quot; is explicitly discriminated among all other assets/commodities, while all currencies and their derivatives (e.g. sovereign bonds) are clustered under the generic &quot;FX reserves&quot; name. Across all currencies, renminbi is best positioned to increase its share in reserve assets and international settlement. Unlike renminbi, gold is nobody&#x27;s liability and has no counterparty risk (assuming no jurisdiction risk, which can be greatly mitigated by storing the gold bullion domestically).<br><br>Given this, I expect the European countries to increase their gold holdings, via a combination of swaps from USD-denominated assets for gold and other FX currencies like the Chinese Yen.</p>
