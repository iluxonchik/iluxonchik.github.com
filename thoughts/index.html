Gold doesn't need Bitcoin", "articleBody": "Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.\n\nBitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. \n\nWhile gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.\n\nGold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.\n\nElectronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. \n\nDigital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them\n\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761122490.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761122490.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/097682b6-14c6-56c5-a661-f1c31964f071.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend", "articleBody": "silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend\n\nthis represents a ≈27% correction from the top\n\nthis is the lowest possible bottom for this move -

if gold's price get rejected at that price level again - you'll likely see the fall to ≈$3900 target I described in my previous post

        <p>if you think they crypto will replace banks, you don't understand what banks are and how they work

banks are credit institutions. it doesn't matter if they process transactions in COBOL, Bitcoin or Solidity

DLTs can and will save on costs, but that will also open opportunities for banks to expand further

it's not about the underlying technology - the credit can be issued on-chain via tokens, but there will still be heavy regulations and authorization requirements

DLTs/blockchains won't magically replace banks</p>

        <p>but Bitcoin is also taxed and surveilled - the ledger is public and attributable 😄

most of Bitcoin's trading volume is in central-bank issued currencies. actually, it's mostly the USD - so Bitcoin is highly susceptible to U.S. currency risk

so yes, bitcoin is risky. that's the premise of no free lunch in financial markets 😄</p>

AI can create another Bitcoin protocol and program the node logic, but AI won't be able to create gold

AI will also need to gold for the signal connectors in the electronics that the AI runs on

It's chemistry/physics vs computer code. You can write new code, but you can't create new Au (without it being very, very expensive)</p>

        <p>Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin

TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.

Bitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. 

While gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.

Gold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.

Electronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. 

Digital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them

This is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition</p>

        <p>silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend

this represents a ≈27% correction from the top

this is the lowest possible bottom for this move - it probably won't go this low. if it does, the move will happen fast, so have your buy limit orders ready. next week is FOMC interest rate decision. the Fed will cut the rates by another 25bps, and other things equal - it's positive price pressure for silver

if the price breaks below $47, it will likely fall closer to $45. expect a stronger support in the $43-45 area

overall, any prices in the vicinity of September 15th 2025 prices is a GREAT buying opportunity

* keep in mind the total 75 bps interest rate cut by the Fed this year is already in progress of being priced in - the market doesn't wait for the official announcement. this is one of the reasons why you had so much upside price volatility in the last month</p>

            <p>1 month ago I wrote that silver could extend its current move to ≈60% from the ≈$34.5 price level

silver topped exactly there at ≈$54.5

treat the pullback and any price consolidation action as a buying opportunity

during the next 6 months long positions entered in this area will be in profit. likely sooner, but 180 days provides a higher confidence timeline</p>

            <p>silver's current move is already up >25%. it's better to have a pullback somewhere around the current level

it can move up even further, extending the total move to ≈60%, but then you’ll get a larger and longer lasting pull back

when silver moves in smaller increments, it has shorter-lasting consolidations/pullbacks. so this is what i mean by "better"</p>

        <p>gold has formed a double top on the 4H chart 📈 

that's why I wrote that buy orders below the current prices are a good idea

i'd prioritize buying opportunities in silver + gold & silver miners on this pullback

gold is also a great idea, but you'll get more volatility/relative upside in others</p>

if you didn't set your limit buy orders for silver, gold & miners - it's not too late yet

keep watching the gold price - it's the main driver for all

        <p>Bitcoin isn't private - at best it's anonymous

and this is by design. it's just cryptography/math - not much to argue about

but gold transactions aren't private either. most of the time they're not even anonymous. you must have some level of trust with the counterparty - either directly or via intermediary. a lot of the times this is required by law

at retail level, there is much more privacy and anonymity with Bitcoin that with gold

gold has clearly more intrinsic value than bitcoin, but bitcoin is one of the most significant advancements in money. although bitcoin isn't money 😄</p>

        <p>it's not about lowering gold

and nobody is panicking

pro-crypto shill is about gold now because gold has has been the most notable asset post-interest rate cuts by the Fed

not long ago it was about dumping ETH for BTC, and by default it's about inflation/currency debasement

gold has been impressive. but this is very expected. during gold's last consolidation i've written extensively about how it's setting up very strong support and will make the uptrend continuation even more decisive. every dip was indeed a buying opportunity</p>

gold has existed for ≈13 billion years

for at least 5,000 of those 13,000,000 years it has been money

authenticity of gold bars can be tested easily. no need to make up problems that don't exist</p>

        <p>my vibe meter on Bitcoin is off the charts 📈*

the algorithm on X has been pushing a lot of pro-BTC content over the past month, and it's becoming more and more irrational: 

accounts with millions of followers recycling 2024 news about "new" gold reserves in China, false news about China legalizing Bitcoin and calls for gold going down to $2000

every pro-Bitcoin account seems to be calling a long-term gold top (LOL!) and heavy rotation into Bitcoin. actually a lot of BTC shill content is about BTC being better than gold - and the arguments for it aren't very sound. i've written several posts explaining this. BTC crowd seems very obsessed about gold - especially when it comes to showing how it's inferior to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not gold - and it will never be gold - they're very different assets. that doesn't mean that BTC ownership is a bad idea - but it's important important to approach it rationally 

a large part of this seems coordinated/paid campaigns. liquidity always needs an exit

so Bitcoin should continue with some more downside in the near future

* this sentiment is based on vibes, but it's backed by technicals & fundamentals at its base. you can find in-depth explanations in my past posts and threads</p>

        <p>governments are already converting from physical currencies to digital currencies

and it makes sense - it's cheaper, more traceable and more controllable. digital currencies are programmable - purely physical are not

i wrote a thread about how virtually central banks are moving to digital currencies - via retail & wholesale CBDCs:
