        <p>Standing Repo Facility (SRF) is a policy rate set by the Fed, according to the target rate. so unless the target rate is decreased, SRF rate is unlikely to be reduced

this situation is putting pressure on the Fed to decrease interest rates and start QE soon</p>

        <p>most of auctioned Treasury bills in 2025 are bought domestically

foreign investors are net sellers, so the new T-bill supply is being absorbed by US-based institutions
