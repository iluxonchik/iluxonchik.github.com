Even assuming that Bitcoin is an inflation hedge - it still doesn't mean that Central Banks should hold it. What would be the purpose of that? Central Banks are not commercial institutions - they hold assets for very specific reasons (e.g. FX rate stabilization).\n\n2. You may have misunderstood me. I said that Bitcoin isn't money - but that by itself doesn't mean that Central Banks shouldn't hold it. FIAT currencies aren't money either. Neither are government bonds. BUT - those bonds or currencies generally don't crash >50% on cycle tops. So it's the fact that it's not money, combined with the other points I mentioned here and in the article that i linked\n\n3. Kaspa isn't money. It certainly hasn't been long enough to be classified as money, nor it has enough intrinsic value. It carries the same set of technology risks as other cryptocurrencies- and even without looking at the chart - I can tell you that it's correlated to the rest of the crypto market. \n\nI am a big fan of crypto, but we need to keep it real 😄\n\nThis X account (@DavidFBailey) , like thousands of others, shill Bitcoin/Crypto non-stop, with little reasoning behind it.

While there have been some ELTIF tokenization initiatives by some funds in the EU - they all used non-public (e.g. in-house) distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions, with scarce public information on the implementation details.\n\nThe idea of fully on-chain ELTIF is attractive for several reasons:\n\n➖ It taps into trillions of USD of readily available on-chain liquidity\n➖ It reduces processing, compliance, distribution and infrastructure costs\n➖It's fully compliant with the existing EU legislation\n\nIn terms of DeFi, bridging the real world financial system on-chain enables investment vehicles, which are fully compliant with the legal systems in the EU, and by extension most jurisdictions. This increases the value of the whole DeFi ecosystem, by making it more attractive for institutional and retail investment.\n\nTo date, there isn't a clear and practical framework for operating an ELTIF fund on a public, permissionless DLT. Such a framework must encapsulate not only the legal aspects (those already exist - the relevant regulations themselves!), but also the technical details of operating the ELTIF fund via smart contracts, while remaining fully compliant with the EU legislation. This is the gap that I’m aiming to address.\n\nI’ll be focusing on real-estate based ELTIFs - where the fund pools money from investors, invests it into real estate and collects yield from rents and appreciation, as it goes inline with my current area of work.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/tokenizing-european-long-term-investment-funds-eltif-2-0-on.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/tokenizing-european-long-term-investment-funds-eltif-2-0-on.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-30T11:30:14+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-30T11:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b69e5486-bc2f-5b6f-b16b-3908af13e561.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "So the Fed will fully resume Treasury purchasing, as a part of their balance sheet expansion starting…", "articleBody": "So the Fed will fully resume Treasury purchasing, as a part of their balance sheet expansion starting December 1st 2025\n\nNot only all maturing Treasuries will be rolled over at auctions, but also all Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) principal will be reinvested into Treasury bills (<1 year duration)\n\nThis will lower the duration of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet and contribute to debt monetization\n\nBut that's not a surprise. 3 months ago I explained why interest rate cuts and the end of QT/start of QE is imminent", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/so-the-fed-will-fully-resume-treasury-purchasing-as-a-part.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/so-the-fed-will-fully-resume-treasury-purchasing-as-a-part.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-29T19:21:58+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-29T19:21:58+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/9e9d3708-c5df-5c52-9b13-6cdd432ff7f7.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "How exactly does Bitcoin break U.S. dollar control, when >90% of Bitcoin's buying volume is USD-derived…", "articleBody": "How exactly does Bitcoin break U.S. dollar control, when >90% of Bitcoin's buying volume is USD-derived (including stablecoins)?", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-exactly-does-bitcoin-break-u-s-dollar-control-when-90-of.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-exactly-does-bitcoin-break-u-s-dollar-control-when-90-of.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-29T17:53:26+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-29T17:53:26+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/091b4b36-1bbb-5888-99e6-c1b096fcb36a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "IMPORTANT message from finance cat:", "articleBody": "IMPORTANT message from finance cat:\n\n\"I hope you bought gold, silver and their miners. - October 2025\"", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/important-message-from-finance-cat.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/important-message-from-finance-cat.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-26T11:34:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-26T11:34:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/bfc9f49d-16c1-5f4c-8f82-2ef4d3e1ead6.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards", "articleBody": "All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards\n\nAnd some still think that Bitcoin will be the next reserve currency. Judging by the actions of the sovereigns positioning their local monetary units for reserve currency position that is highly unlikely 😁\n\nMore specifically, China & BRICS are heavily buying gold, and they have openly discussed partly gold-backed currencies several times. In the EU, the ECB is very clear on their stance against adding Bitcoin to their reserves.\n\nBitcoin doesn't exhibit the characteristics necessary for a reserve currency. If you believe that it does, then you need to start by explaining how it would integrate into the current financial system. Do not forget to consider Central Banks, wholesale debt markets and refinancing cycles. A potential role that Bitcoin may take is as collateral, for example in money markets. The problem is, that you will be inadvertently running into very large haircuts and low LTVs. So unless Bitcoin concisely keeps yielding higher highs, you'd be better off by using higher-quality collateral, such as government bonds or even equities.\n\nAnother point comes down to risk. The more Bitcoin is used the more risky it becomes. Sure, you can say that the network also growth with usage, but in case Central Banks start holding Bitcoin - it becomes a geopolitical liability. It will become a matter of time before disruptive attack and compromise of private keys. Also, >90% of the buy volume of Bitcoin is in USD or its derivatives, such as USD-pegged stablecoins. So it's USD that's mostly invested there, not euros, renminbi or others. This makes Bitcoin extremely exposed to USD currency risk.\n\nGold and silver have a much more modest exposure to the risks above. You don’t have to believe me - just look at the history.

Gold doesn't need Bitcoin", "articleBody": "Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.\n\nBitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. \n\nWhile gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.\n\nGold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.\n\nElectronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. \n\nDigital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them\n\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/097682b6-14c6-56c5-a661-f1c31964f071.jpg"}]}

If you think that Bitcoin is harder to seize than gold, you are probably wrong. At least according to the data.

In the history of Bitcoin's existence, much much more Bitcoin has been seized than Gold. You don't need to compromise cryptographic primitives to seize Bitcoin. 

Apparently this isn't a very well known fact in the Bitcoin Maxi world 😄</p>

        <p>Gold is within the fabric of money, not just Central Banks

A lot of posts on X frame Central Banks as malevolent institutions, and by some form of conspiracy they hold gold in their reserve accounts. And apparently not holding gold is a step towards monetary freedom - even more if you forego an atomic element (Au) for a cryptographic computer algorithm (Bitcoin).

A more productive approach is asking why do Central Banks chose gold over all other commodities and assets. Every single world reserve currency, without exception, started on a gold and/or silver standard. Gold has been used as money for over 5000 years.

I've written several articles on what makes gold so special and how Bitcoin is not a replacement for gold. I'll leave them linked below</p>

        <p>Multiple governments have sized Bitcoin

In fact, more Bitcoin has been seized than gold in the U.S. It's really not hard to google this, but here are some examples:

- Silk Road takedown (2013–2015) - ≈175K BTC
- "Individual X" Silk Road stash (2020) - ≈75K BTC
- Bitfinex-hack recovery (2022) - >94K BTC
- Movie2K piracy case - ≈50K BTC
- Finland Customs seizures - ≈2K BTC
- Netherlands money-laundering case - ≈2.5K BTC
- China PlusToken crackdown ≈200K BTC

Regarding gold - yes, it was seized in the past in the US, but it was at a much smaller scale than you imagine.

The publicly documented, conservative floor for government-seized BTC is ≈700K BTC (≈$77B today), which is already above the $58–110B value range for U.S. public gold coin surrendered in 1933–34.

If your argument is that Bitcoin is better than gold, because it's more private/seizure resistant - you are wrong.

If you think that by holding Bitcoin you're immune to U.S. government policies you're also wrong, as more than 90% of all Bitcoin buying volume comes from USD or USD derivatives (including stablecoins).</p>

        <p>Why would a Central Bank hold Bitcoin in reserves?

1. Even assuming that Bitcoin is an inflation hedge - it still doesn't mean that Central Banks should hold it. What would be the purpose of that? Central Banks are not commercial institutions - they hold assets for very specific reasons (e.g. FX rate stabilization).

2. You may have misunderstood me. I said that Bitcoin isn't money - but that by itself doesn't mean that Central Banks shouldn't hold it. FIAT currencies aren't money either. Neither are government bonds. BUT - those bonds or currencies generally don't crash >50% on cycle tops. So it's the fact that it's not money, combined with the other points I mentioned here and in the article that i linked

3. Kaspa isn't money. It certainly hasn't been long enough to be classified as money, nor it has enough intrinsic value. It carries the same set of technology risks as other cryptocurrencies- and even without looking at the chart - I can tell you that it's correlated to the rest of the crypto market. 

I am a big fan of crypto, but we need to keep it real 😄

This X account (@DavidFBailey) , like thousands of others, shill Bitcoin/Crypto non-stop, with little reasoning behind it. They either do it for pay, engagement or a mix of both.

You don't have to look far - usually just search for "gold" on their profile and you'll find something like this (see screenshot).

If you want to understand how Bitcoin is not gold, it will never be gold, and it will never replace gold - read this article: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html</a></p>

        <p>Is the rotation from Gold to Bitcoin in the room with us? 😉

Over the past 2 weeks hundreds of X accounts with large following have been posting about an imminent rotation from gold to Bitcoin, once gold reaches a correction level.

Their main argument seemed to be based on Bitcoin's historic price correlation - essentially "here are some select occurrences from the past where this happened, so it will happen now". Many of them went as far as claiming that gold has topped in this cycle (it hasn't).

Local top for gold was reached, but rotation didn't happen. As I've been alluding to over this same timeframe - the reality in financial market is seldom this simplistic.

In general, you should be very wary of market thesis that are too abstract, or fail to consider the macro picture.</p>

        <p>Tokenizing European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) on a Public Blockchain

Currently I'm working on a practical framework for tokenizing European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) instruments on a smart contract-enabled public blockchain like Ethereum. While there have been some ELTIF tokenization initiatives by some funds in the EU - they all used non-public (e.g. in-house) distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions, with scarce public information on the implementation details.

The idea of fully on-chain ELTIF is attractive for several reasons:

➖ It taps into trillions of USD of readily available on-chain liquidity
➖ It reduces processing, compliance, distribution and infrastructure costs
➖It's fully compliant with the existing EU legislation

In terms of DeFi, bridging the real world financial system on-chain enables investment vehicles, which are fully compliant with the legal systems in the EU, and by extension most jurisdictions. This increases the value of the whole DeFi ecosystem, by making it more attractive for institutional and retail investment.

To date, there isn't a clear and practical framework for operating an ELTIF fund on a public, permissionless DLT. Such a framework must encapsulate not only the legal aspects (those already exist - the relevant regulations themselves!), but also the technical details of operating the ELTIF fund via smart contracts, while remaining fully compliant with the EU legislation. This is the gap that I’m aiming to address.

I’ll be focusing on real-estate based ELTIFs - where the fund pools money from investors, invests it into real estate and collects yield from rents and appreciation, as it goes inline with my current area of work.</p>

        <p>So the Fed will fully resume Treasury purchasing, as a part of their balance sheet expansion starting December 1st 2025

Not only all maturing Treasuries will be rolled over at auctions, but also all Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) principal will be reinvested into Treasury bills (<1 year duration)

This will lower the duration of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet and contribute to debt monetization

But that's not a surprise. 3 months ago I explained why interest rate cuts and the end of QT/start of QE is imminent</p>

        <p>All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards

And some still think that Bitcoin will be the next reserve currency. Judging by the actions of the sovereigns positioning their local monetary units for reserve currency position that is highly unlikely 😁

More specifically, China & BRICS are heavily buying gold, and they have openly discussed partly gold-backed currencies several times. In the EU, the ECB is very clear on their stance against adding Bitcoin to their reserves.

Bitcoin doesn't exhibit the characteristics necessary for a reserve currency. If you believe that it does, then you need to start by explaining how it would integrate into the current financial system. Do not forget to consider Central Banks, wholesale debt markets and refinancing cycles. A potential role that Bitcoin may take is as collateral, for example in money markets. The problem is, that you will be inadvertently running into very large haircuts and low LTVs. So unless Bitcoin concisely keeps yielding higher highs, you'd be better off by using higher-quality collateral, such as government bonds or even equities.

Another point comes down to risk. The more Bitcoin is used the more risky it becomes. Sure, you can say that the network also growth with usage, but in case Central Banks start holding Bitcoin - it becomes a geopolitical liability. It will become a matter of time before disruptive attack and compromise of private keys. Also, >90% of the buy volume of Bitcoin is in USD or its derivatives, such as USD-pegged stablecoins. So it's USD that's mostly invested there, not euros, renminbi or others. This makes Bitcoin extremely exposed to USD currency risk.

Gold and silver have a much more modest exposure to the risks above. You don’t have to believe me - just look at the history. Since 500 BCE it's mostly been gold and/or silver - and Bitcoin doesn't change that.

Accounts on X that relentlessly promote the idea of Bitcoin being money, and better money than gold fail to address these points.</p>

banks are credit institutions. it doesn't matter if they process transactions in COBOL, Bitcoin or Solidity

DLTs can and will save on costs, but that will also open opportunities for banks to expand further

it's not about the underlying technology - the credit can be issued on-chain via tokens, but there will still be heavy regulations and authorization requirements

DLTs/blockchains won't magically replace banks</p>

most of Bitcoin's trading volume is in central-bank issued currencies. actually, it's mostly the USD - so Bitcoin is highly susceptible to U.S. currency risk

so yes, bitcoin is risky. that's the premise of no free lunch in financial markets 😄</p>

        <p>Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin

TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.

Bitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. 

While gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.

Gold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.

Electronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. 

Digital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them

This is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition</p>
