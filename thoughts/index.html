A quick search didn't yield precise figures for 2026, as it appears that that information is not reported publicly in detail. The access to that gold at BoE is currently blocked, over a legal dispute regarding who has the authority/control over that gold - Maduro-appointed BCV board or Guaidó-appointed board. Thus, a significant portion of Venezuela's gold is abroad and frozen, which matters in terms of geopolitical risk.\n\nBNV's 20% are relatively high gold amounts against the central bank's total balance sheet size, surpassing U.S.'s Fed (≈16%), China's PBoC (≈5%) and just above European Union's ECB + Eurosystem (≈19.1%), but well behind Russia's BoR (≈36%).", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/venezuelas-central-bank-monetary-gold-holdings-constitute-20.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/venezuelas-central-bank-monetary-gold-holdings-constitute-20.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-08T12:13:42+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-08T12:13:42+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b27f4f3e-34be-54a3-ac45-60886c633396.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Bulgraria has been pegged to Euro since 1999 🇧🇬", "articleBody": "Bulgraria has been pegged to Euro since 1999 🇧🇬\n\nBulgaria has adopted Euro as its official currency and legal tender on January 1st 2026.\n\nAs you may have expected, there is now a lot of discourse about how this is bad for Bulgaria, because Euro is bad and Bulgaria has now given up their \"monetary sovereignty\".\n\nWhat the ones pushing that narrative have not expected is for the Bulgarian lev (BGN) to be a proxy for Euro for almost 3 decades now. So it's not very clear which sovereignty Bulgaria gave up on January 1st 2026, when it became a full Eurozone member.\n\nSince 1997 Bulgaria has operated under a currency board arrangement (CBA), which is an exchange rate regime where a country commits to keep its local currency to a fixed exchange rate against an anchor currency.\n\nUnder CBA, the adhering country fixes the exchange rate of its local currency to an anchor currency, its national central bank fully backs its monetary liabilities with foreign reserves (to create local currency the national central bank must have foreign currency assets to back it up, thus ensuring stable convertibility), and the country foregoes its right to adapt discretionary monetary policy (e.g. inflation rate targeting).\n\nOn July 1st 1997, Bulgaria introduced the currency board, pegging lev (BGL) to the Deutsche Mark (DM). On January 1st 1999, Bulgaria switched the anchor currency from Deutsche Mark to Euro, with the exchange rate fixed at €1 = 1.95583 BGN (≈0.5 BGN/EUR).\n\nSo the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) neither had the sovereignty to manage the broad and base supplies of its local currency (Bulgarian lev/BGL/BGN), nor to freely pursue monetary policies since July 1st 1997.\n\nGiven this, any discourse about how Bulgaria's entry into the Eurozone implies a dramatic change to its monetary sovereignty is likely unfounded. It didn't happen overnight - it's been an almost 30 year long process. Joining the Eurozone does, however, remove the pegging frictions for Bulgaria, and allows them to fully integrate into the monetary union.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bulgraria-has-been-pegged-to-euro-since-1999.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bulgraria-has-been-pegged-to-euro-since-1999.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-06T13:03:18+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-06T13:03:18+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/f89c5464-1336-57ad-9534-d029680b3470.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "The U.S. Violated International Law By Attacking Venezuela and Capturing Maduro", "articleBody": "The U.S. Violated International Law By Attacking Venezuela and Capturing Maduro\n\nBoth the U.S. and Venezuela are signees & parties of the UN Charter, making it a legally binding treaty for both countries. This means that both of the countries are forbidden from using force against sovereign states, as per Article 2(4), which states:\n\n➖ \"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\"\n\nCrossing the border with military force to seize someone is clearly a \"use of force\" against that state, meaning it's a violation of the provision.\n\nThere are some exceptions to Article 2(4), such as self-defense in responding to an armed attack (Article 51), prior authorization for force by the UN Security Council and . United State's actions do not fall under those exceptions. As such, USA is in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, making their actions illegal under the international law. \n\nEven if the U.S. that they are not in violation of their national laws, they would still be violating the international law. Vienna Convention on The Law of Treaties (VCLT) is the \"treaty about treaties\", by outlining base rules for how treaties are made, interpreted, applied and ended. Article 27 of VCLT states:\n\n➖ \"A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\"\n\nRegarding VCLT, the U.S. signed it in April 1970, but they didn't ratify it/they're not a party in it, meaning it's not a directly legally binding treaty for the U.S. However, U.S. courts often treat VCLT as an authoritative guide to customary international law of treaties.\n\nAdditionally, Article 103 of the UN Charter puts the obligations outlined in the UN Charter above any other treaty obligations, meaning that Article 2(4) must be respected:\n\n➖\"In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail.\"\n\nIf the U.S. takes military action against Cuba, Cambodia, Denmark (Greenland) or any other sovereign in a similar manner, it would equally be a violation of the international law.\n\nInterestingly enough, in 1945 the U.S. helped to draft the same UN Charter that it is now violating.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/the-u-s-violated-international-law-by-attacking-venezuela.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/the-u-s-violated-international-law-by-attacking-venezuela.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-05T13:54:18+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-05T13:54:18+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/e7a86aaf-02d6-57b4-b1b9-7501cb629dd1.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "It's NOT about paying the debt, but BEING ABLE to pay the debt", "articleBody": "It's NOT about paying the debt, but BEING ABLE to pay the debt\n\nThis is true for corporations, individuals and governments:\n\n➖ For corporations, debt provides a tax shield (interest payments is an accounting expense)\n\n➖ For individuals, it allows to front-run price increase in a monetary debasement/inflationary economy\n\n➖For governments, it allows for more flexibility in pursuing their macroeconomic, social, geopolitical and monetary policy goals.\n\nWhy do you think central banks have gold and foreign currencies in their balance sheet backing up their local currency?

So I connected to the ESP32 with a LoRA module over bluetooth, and was able to send and receive messages from a Python script running on a laptop.\n\nEssentially, the laptop uses the microcontroller as a proxy for the sub-GHz antenna (EU_868/≈868 MHz in Europe), enabling it to send and receive LoRa messages via Meshtastic's firmware. So effectively Bluetooth Low Energy is used as a proxy protocol for LoRa.\n\nThere were two nodes in the mesh - one connected to the laptop and another to a smartphone. Both nodes had the same channel name, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and ordering (channel id) setup. The laptop node was using Python to connect to the mesh via BLE and exchange messages. The smartphone was connected to the other node, and the official Meshtastic app was used to send and receive messages.\n\nThe setup is as follows:\n\n💻 Laptop (Python)\n   ⇅ BLE\n📡 Node A (ESP32 + LoRa)\n   ≈≈≈ 868 MHz LoRa mesh ≈≈≈\n📡 Node B (ESP32 + LoRa)\n   ⇅ BLE\n📱 Phone (Meshtastic app)\n\nSo you don't really need to program the ESP32 to make it a \"smart\" LoRa node. You can program all of the logic on your usual dev machine, and use BLE as a proxy for LoRa packets over Meshtastic. This is a great approach for iterative development, prototyping, proof of concepts and even final products. Of course, you can also put the smart node code on a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or even the microcontroller itself.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/laptop-as-a-meshtastic-lora-node-using-esp32-ble-and-python.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/laptop-as-a-meshtastic-lora-node-using-esp32-ble-and-python.html", "datePublished": "2025-12-06T15:51:27+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-12-06T15:51:27+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/dfc958f2-2831-552f-bdb9-34ba63a1e343.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website", "articleBody": "Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website\n\nYou can now filter my articles by topic at https://illya.sh/threads/topics/\n\nQwen3-Embedding-0.6B is used to vectorize and embed all of the articles/threads, which are then tagged/categorized based on natural language tags for the category.\nThis allows me to define a new category by defining a new Python class with the topic/category name, description, URL path, and the query sting to embed and query against the thread embeddings.

        <p>Venezuela&#x27;s Central Bank Monetary Gold Holdings Constitute ≈20% of Their Balance Sheet<br><br>Gold is also ≈47% of Venezuela&#x27;s international reserve assets.<br><br>This comes directly from Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV), which reports a total of ≈53 tonnes of gold worth ≈0.6 Trillion VES (Venezuelan Bolívar, also known as Bs), or ≈5.58 billion USD.<br><br>In 2021, Reuters reported that ≈31 tonnes of Venezuela&#x27;s Centeal Bank gold was stored in the UK, under the custody of Bank of England (BoE). A quick search didn&#x27;t yield precise figures for 2026, as it appears that that information is not reported publicly in detail. The access to that gold at BoE is currently blocked, over a legal dispute regarding who has the authority/control over that gold - Maduro-appointed BCV board or Guaidó-appointed board. Thus, a significant portion of Venezuela&#x27;s gold is abroad and frozen, which matters in terms of geopolitical risk.<br><br>BNV&#x27;s 20% are relatively high gold amounts against the central bank&#x27;s total balance sheet size, surpassing U.S.&#x27;s Fed (≈16%), China&#x27;s PBoC (≈5%) and just above European Union&#x27;s ECB + Eurosystem (≈19.1%), but well behind Russia&#x27;s BoR (≈36%).</p>

    <div class="thought-content">
        <p>Bulgraria has been pegged to Euro since 1999 🇧🇬<br><br>Bulgaria has adopted Euro as its official currency and legal tender on January 1st 2026.<br><br>As you may have expected, there is now a lot of discourse about how this is bad for Bulgaria, because Euro is bad and Bulgaria has now given up their &quot;monetary sovereignty&quot;.<br><br>What the ones pushing that narrative have not expected is for the Bulgarian lev (BGN) to be a proxy for Euro for almost 3 decades now. So it&#x27;s not very clear which sovereignty Bulgaria gave up on January 1st 2026, when it became a full Eurozone member.<br><br>Since 1997 Bulgaria has operated under a currency board arrangement (CBA), which is an exchange rate regime where a country commits to keep its local currency to a fixed exchange rate against an anchor currency.<br><br>Under CBA, the adhering country fixes the exchange rate of its local currency to an anchor currency, its national central bank fully backs its monetary liabilities with foreign reserves (to create local currency the national central bank must have foreign currency assets to back it up, thus ensuring stable convertibility), and the country foregoes its right to adapt discretionary monetary policy (e.g. inflation rate targeting).<br><br>On July 1st 1997, Bulgaria introduced the currency board, pegging lev (BGL) to the Deutsche Mark (DM). On January 1st 1999, Bulgaria switched the anchor currency from Deutsche Mark to Euro, with the exchange rate fixed at €1 = 1.95583 BGN (≈0.5 BGN/EUR).<br><br>So the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) neither had the sovereignty to manage the broad and base supplies of its local currency (Bulgarian lev/BGL/BGN), nor to freely pursue monetary policies since July 1st 1997.<br><br>Given this, any discourse about how Bulgaria&#x27;s entry into the Eurozone implies a dramatic change to its monetary sovereignty is likely unfounded. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight - it&#x27;s been an almost 30 year long process. Joining the Eurozone does, however, remove the pegging frictions for Bulgaria, and allows them to fully integrate into the monetary union.</p>

        <p>The U.S. Violated International Law By Attacking Venezuela and Capturing Maduro<br><br>Both the U.S. and Venezuela are signees &amp; parties of the UN Charter, making it a legally binding treaty for both countries. This means that both of the countries are forbidden from using force against sovereign states, as per Article 2(4), which states:<br><br>➖ &quot;All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.&quot;<br><br>Crossing the border with military force to seize someone is clearly a &quot;use of force&quot; against that state, meaning it&#x27;s a violation of the provision.<br><br>There are some exceptions to Article 2(4), such as self-defense in responding to an armed attack (Article 51), prior authorization for force by the UN Security Council and . United State&#x27;s actions do not fall under those exceptions. As such, USA is in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, making their actions illegal under the international law. <br><br>Even if the U.S. that they are not in violation of their national laws, they would still be violating the international law. Vienna Convention on The Law of Treaties (VCLT) is the &quot;treaty about treaties&quot;, by outlining base rules for how treaties are made, interpreted, applied and ended. Article 27 of VCLT states:<br><br>➖ &quot;A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.&quot;<br><br>Regarding VCLT, the U.S. signed it in April 1970, but they didn&#x27;t ratify it/they&#x27;re not a party in it, meaning it&#x27;s not a directly legally binding treaty for the U.S. However, U.S. courts often treat VCLT as an authoritative guide to customary international law of treaties.<br><br>Additionally, Article 103 of the UN Charter puts the obligations outlined in the UN Charter above any other treaty obligations, meaning that Article 2(4) must be respected:<br><br>➖&quot;In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail.&quot;<br><br>If the U.S. takes military action against Cuba, Cambodia, Denmark (Greenland) or any other sovereign in a similar manner, it would equally be a violation of the international law.<br><br>Interestingly enough, in 1945 the U.S. helped to draft the same UN Charter that it is now violating.</p>

        <p>Misinformation About Venezuela&#x27;s Gold Reserves Is Spreading 🇻🇪<br><br>It appears that once a large finance account on X posts misinformation about Venezuela&#x27;s gold reserves, many other large-following X accounts repost it without even bothering to verify the information.<br><br>Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) doesn&#x27;t have anywhere close to 161 tonnes of gold - those are numbers from 2017. BCV&#x27;s balance sheet report, alongside the auxiliary notes released with it (specifically Note 7) from June 30th 2025 point at ≈53 tonnes of gold, which is less than a third of the claimed 161 tonnes of gold figure. I know this for a fact, because I checked that balance sheet statement myself.<br><br>On my feed, the incorrect 161 tonnes figure  started with @KobeissiLetter  post earlier today, from there, it continues to spread throughout numerous accounts, many of which have followings in the millions.<br><br>My goal is not to criticize or attack the accounts spreading this incorrect information, but to incentivize checking the information yourself before reposting/spreading it.<br><br>In a follow-up post I&#x27;ll do a more detailed breakdown of BCV&#x27;s balance sheet, especially in terms of gold, so stay tuned.</p>

        <p>LLMs &amp; AI Agents Didn&#x27;t Replace Programming - They Evolved It<br><br>I&#x27;ve been programming with LLMs since 2022, implementing systems of varied complexity, both professionally and exploratory/hobby projects. And I will continue to do so in 2026. However, it&#x27;s important to be aware of its limits.<br><br>Vibe/agent coding for critical systems doesn&#x27;t work well (yet).<br><br>You&#x27;ll also be disappointed if you&#x27;re trying to do something with financial markets (e.g. Machine-Learning based models).<br><br>Vibe coded apps also frequently come with security vulnerabilities (for many apps this may be an acceptable compromise).<br><br>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be comfortable with driving a vehicle with all of its software vibe-coded, or with all code written by an agentic system, without thorough human investment.<br><br>LLMs are good at solving problems that have been solved many time before, but this abstraction quickly breaks apart if you delve with them into less developed topics, which frequent tend to be more complex. Pattern matching based prediction is very powerful, but you need enough patterns to learn from, alongside the correct context.<br><br>Additionally, vibe-coding a large codebase is one thing, while maintaining that same codebase is another.<br><br>Autopilot in commercial airplanes didn&#x27;t deprecate carbon-based human pilots, but it did deprecate pilots who didn&#x27;t commit to learning and integrating autopilot during the flight.<br><br>So is programming really dead, or has it merely evolved? 🤔</p>

        <p>Bulgarian Lev has been pegged to Euro since 1999<br><br>Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) has been operating under a currency board arrangement (CBA) regime since 1997. First, it was pegged to the Deutsche Mark, then to the Euro. They also redenominated their currency from Old Bulgarian Lev (BGL) to New Bulgarian Lev (BGN).<br><br>Under CBA, BNB&#x27;s monetary liabilities must be fully covered by foreign reserves. In other words, if Bulgaria&#x27;s Central Bank wanted to increase the base money supply of their national currency (i.e. monetary liabilities on BNB&#x27;s balance sheet), they needed to foreign reserve assets backing them up at a fixed rate of 1 EUR ≈ 1.96 BGN. In practice, ≈90% of BNB&#x27;s reserves were Euro-denominated, which makes sense, since BGN is pegged to the Euro.<br><br>For those claiming that by adopting the Euro as its official currency on January 1st 2026 Bulgaria has given up its monetary sovereignty - how exactly? BNB has been extremely limited in pursuing discretionary monetary policies since 1997.</p>

        <p>Gold hasn&#x27;t even touched its daily level uptrend support and finance accounts on X are already calling for a top<br><br>I have been writing my price thesis on gold for 2 years now, and since my call in December 2023 gold&#x27;s price is up ≈125%.

I&#x27;ve written several articles explaining why gold&#x27;s price will keep going up, in terms of currency debasement, refinancing cycles, global liquidity and geopolitical pressures.

    <div class="thought-content">
        <p>Laptop as a Meshtastic LoRa Node Using ESP32, BLE and Python<br><br>Meshtastic exposes a BLE interface and comes with a nice Python library. So I connected to the ESP32 with a LoRA module over bluetooth, and was able to send and receive messages from a Python script running on a laptop.<br><br>Essentially, the laptop uses the microcontroller as a proxy for the sub-GHz antenna (EU_868/≈868 MHz in Europe), enabling it to send and receive LoRa messages via Meshtastic&#x27;s firmware. So effectively Bluetooth Low Energy is used as a proxy protocol for LoRa.<br><br>There were two nodes in the mesh - one connected to the laptop and another to a smartphone. Both nodes had the same channel name, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and ordering (channel id) setup. The laptop node was using Python to connect to the mesh via BLE and exchange messages. The smartphone was connected to the other node, and the official Meshtastic app was used to send and receive messages.<br><br>The setup is as follows:<br><br>💻 Laptop (Python)<br>   ⇅ BLE<br>📡 Node A (ESP32 + LoRa)<br>   ≈≈≈ 868 MHz LoRa mesh ≈≈≈<br>📡 Node B (ESP32 + LoRa)<br>   ⇅ BLE<br>📱 Phone (Meshtastic app)<br><br>So you don&#x27;t really need to program the ESP32 to make it a &quot;smart&quot; LoRa node. You can program all of the logic on your usual dev machine, and use BLE as a proxy for LoRa packets over Meshtastic. This is a great approach for iterative development, prototyping, proof of concepts and even final products. Of course, you can also put the smart node code on a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or even the microcontroller itself.</p>

        <p>Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website<br><br>You can now filter my articles by topic at <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/topics/" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/topics/</a><br><br>Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is used to vectorize and embed all of the articles/threads, which are then tagged/categorized based on natural language tags for the category.<br>This allows me to define a new category by defining a new Python class with the topic/category name, description, URL path, and the query sting to embed and query against the thread embeddings. From there, all of the content is generated statically. <br><br>Everything runs 100% locally/offline. Model weights are pre-downloaded once - that&#x27;s the most time-consuming part. <br><br>The motivation for implementing this has to with the content&#x27;s volume. I have written over 180 articles/threads, but until now there was no categorization. So if you wanted to read an article on a particular topic, you&#x27;d either have to google it, ask an LLM or go through the list manually yourself. Now, there is an index with topics, which help navigating the content semantically.<br><br>Navigate to <a href="https://t.co/bXb1JWKD4d," target="_blank">https://t.co/bXb1JWKD4d,</a> select a topic, and you will be presented paginated list of all threads/articles matching that topic.</p>
