While there have been some ELTIF tokenization initiatives by some funds in the EU - they all used non-public (e.g. in-house) distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions, with scarce public information on the implementation details.\n\nThe idea of fully on-chain ELTIF is attractive for several reasons:\n\n➖ It taps into trillions of USD of readily available on-chain liquidity\n➖ It reduces processing, compliance, distribution and infrastructure costs\n➖It's fully compliant with the existing EU legislation\n\nIn terms of DeFi, bridging the real world financial system on-chain enables investment vehicles, which are fully compliant with the legal systems in the EU, and by extension most jurisdictions. This increases the value of the whole DeFi ecosystem, by making it more attractive for institutional and retail investment.\n\nTo date, there isn't a clear and practical framework for operating an ELTIF fund on a public, permissionless DLT. Such a framework must encapsulate not only the legal aspects (those already exist - the relevant regulations themselves!), but also the technical details of operating the ELTIF fund via smart contracts, while remaining fully compliant with the EU legislation. This is the gap that I’m aiming to address.\n\nI’ll be focusing on real-estate based ELTIFs - where the fund pools money from investors, invests it into real estate and collects yield from rents and appreciation, as it goes inline with my current area of work.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761823814.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761823814.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-30T11:30:14+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-30T11:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b69e5486-bc2f-5b6f-b16b-3908af13e561.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "So the Fed will fully resume Treasury purchasing, as a part of their balance sheet expansion starting…", "articleBody": "So the Fed will fully resume Treasury purchasing, as a part of their balance sheet expansion starting December 1st 2025\n\nNot only all maturing Treasuries will be rolled over at auctions, but also all Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) principal will be reinvested into Treasury bills (<1 year duration)\n\nThis will lower the duration of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet and contribute to debt monetization\n\nBut that's not a surprise. 3 months ago I explained why interest rate cuts and the end of QT/start of QE is imminent", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761765718.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761765718.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-29T19:21:58+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-29T19:21:58+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/9e9d3708-c5df-5c52-9b13-6cdd432ff7f7.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "How exactly does Bitcoin break U.S. dollar control, when >90% of Bitcoin's buying volume is USD-derived…", "articleBody": "How exactly does Bitcoin break U.S. dollar control, when >90% of Bitcoin's buying volume is USD-derived (including stablecoins)?", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761760406.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761760406.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-29T17:53:26+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-29T17:53:26+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/091b4b36-1bbb-5888-99e6-c1b096fcb36a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "IMPORTANT message from finance cat:", "articleBody": "IMPORTANT message from finance cat:\n\n\"I hope you bought gold, silver and their miners. - October 2025\"", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761478446.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761478446.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-26T11:34:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-26T11:34:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/bfc9f49d-16c1-5f4c-8f82-2ef4d3e1ead6.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards", "articleBody": "All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards\n\nAnd some still think that Bitcoin will be the next reserve currency. Judging by the actions of the sovereigns positioning their local monetary units for reserve currency position that is highly unlikely 😁\n\nMore specifically, China & BRICS are heavily buying gold, and they have openly discussed partly gold-backed currencies several times. In the EU, the ECB is very clear on their stance against adding Bitcoin to their reserves.\n\nBitcoin doesn't exhibit the characteristics necessary for a reserve currency. If you believe that it does, then you need to start by explaining how it would integrate into the current financial system. Do not forget to consider Central Banks, wholesale debt markets and refinancing cycles. A potential role that Bitcoin may take is as collateral, for example in money markets. The problem is, that you will be inadvertently running into very large haircuts and low LTVs. So unless Bitcoin concisely keeps yielding higher highs, you'd be better off by using higher-quality collateral, such as government bonds or even equities.\n\nAnother point comes down to risk. The more Bitcoin is used the more risky it becomes. Sure, you can say that the network also growth with usage, but in case Central Banks start holding Bitcoin - it becomes a geopolitical liability. It will become a matter of time before disruptive attack and compromise of private keys. Also, >90% of the buy volume of Bitcoin is in USD or its derivatives, such as USD-pegged stablecoins. So it's USD that's mostly invested there, not euros, renminbi or others. This makes Bitcoin extremely exposed to USD currency risk.\n\nGold and silver have a much more modest exposure to the risks above. You don’t have to believe me - just look at the history. Since 500 BCE it's mostly been gold and/or silver - and Bitcoin doesn't change that.\n\nAccounts on X that relentlessly promote the idea of Bitcoin being money, and better money than gold fail to address these points.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761375278.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761375278.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-25T06:54:38+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-25T06:54:38+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b1384ea8-ce9c-5371-8897-1ffa9c7a6e1b.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "a kind reminder that higher oil prices benefit Russia and Ruble", "articleBody": "a kind reminder that higher oil prices benefit Russia and Ruble\n\nU.S. puts sanctions on Russia --> Oil price increases --> Ruble price increases\n\nThis is driven by how Russia's National Wealth Fund (NWF) operates, plus the fact that both NWF and Russia's Central Bank have almost no exposure to USD", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761342427.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1761342427.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-24T21:47:07+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-24T21:47:07+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/0923ee87-fabc-51b8-8558-16ad95ad443a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "GOLD: look for rejection at ≈$4155", "articleBody": "GOLD: look for rejection at ≈$4155\n\nif gold's price get rejected at that price level again -

Gold doesn't need Bitcoin", "articleBody": "Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.\n\nBitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. \n\nWhile gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.\n\nGold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.\n\nElectronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. \n\nDigital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly.

        <p>Tokenizing European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) on a Public Blockchain

Currently I'm working on a practical framework for tokenizing European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) instruments on a smart contract-enabled public blockchain like Ethereum. While there have been some ELTIF tokenization initiatives by some funds in the EU - they all used non-public (e.g. in-house) distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions, with scarce public information on the implementation details.

The idea of fully on-chain ELTIF is attractive for several reasons:

➖ It taps into trillions of USD of readily available on-chain liquidity
➖ It reduces processing, compliance, distribution and infrastructure costs
➖It's fully compliant with the existing EU legislation

In terms of DeFi, bridging the real world financial system on-chain enables investment vehicles, which are fully compliant with the legal systems in the EU, and by extension most jurisdictions. This increases the value of the whole DeFi ecosystem, by making it more attractive for institutional and retail investment.

To date, there isn't a clear and practical framework for operating an ELTIF fund on a public, permissionless DLT. Such a framework must encapsulate not only the legal aspects (those already exist - the relevant regulations themselves!), but also the technical details of operating the ELTIF fund via smart contracts, while remaining fully compliant with the EU legislation. This is the gap that I’m aiming to address.

I’ll be focusing on real-estate based ELTIFs - where the fund pools money from investors, invests it into real estate and collects yield from rents and appreciation, as it goes inline with my current area of work.</p>

        <p>So the Fed will fully resume Treasury purchasing, as a part of their balance sheet expansion starting December 1st 2025

Not only all maturing Treasuries will be rolled over at auctions, but also all Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) principal will be reinvested into Treasury bills (<1 year duration)

This will lower the duration of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet and contribute to debt monetization

        <p>All reserve currencies achieved reserve status under gold or silver standards

And some still think that Bitcoin will be the next reserve currency. Judging by the actions of the sovereigns positioning their local monetary units for reserve currency position that is highly unlikely 😁

More specifically, China & BRICS are heavily buying gold, and they have openly discussed partly gold-backed currencies several times. In the EU, the ECB is very clear on their stance against adding Bitcoin to their reserves.

Bitcoin doesn't exhibit the characteristics necessary for a reserve currency. If you believe that it does, then you need to start by explaining how it would integrate into the current financial system. Do not forget to consider Central Banks, wholesale debt markets and refinancing cycles. A potential role that Bitcoin may take is as collateral, for example in money markets. The problem is, that you will be inadvertently running into very large haircuts and low LTVs. So unless Bitcoin concisely keeps yielding higher highs, you'd be better off by using higher-quality collateral, such as government bonds or even equities.

Another point comes down to risk. The more Bitcoin is used the more risky it becomes. Sure, you can say that the network also growth with usage, but in case Central Banks start holding Bitcoin - it becomes a geopolitical liability. It will become a matter of time before disruptive attack and compromise of private keys. Also, >90% of the buy volume of Bitcoin is in USD or its derivatives, such as USD-pegged stablecoins. So it's USD that's mostly invested there, not euros, renminbi or others. This makes Bitcoin extremely exposed to USD currency risk.

Gold and silver have a much more modest exposure to the risks above. You don’t have to believe me - just look at the history. Since 500 BCE it's mostly been gold and/or silver - and Bitcoin doesn't change that.

Accounts on X that relentlessly promote the idea of Bitcoin being money, and better money than gold fail to address these points.</p>

every surplus above $60/barrel of Urals oil increases FX reserves in NWF (Yuan or gold) - an interplay between MoF and CBR

        <p>if you think they crypto will replace banks, you don't understand what banks are and how they work

banks are credit institutions. it doesn't matter if they process transactions in COBOL, Bitcoin or Solidity

DLTs can and will save on costs, but that will also open opportunities for banks to expand further

it's not about the underlying technology - the credit can be issued on-chain via tokens, but there will still be heavy regulations and authorization requirements

DLTs/blockchains won't magically replace banks</p>

        <p>but Bitcoin is also taxed and surveilled - the ledger is public and attributable 😄

most of Bitcoin's trading volume is in central-bank issued currencies. actually, it's mostly the USD - so Bitcoin is highly susceptible to U.S. currency risk

so yes, bitcoin is risky. that's the premise of no free lunch in financial markets 😄</p>

        <p>if AI will want something it would be gold, not Bitcoin

AI can create another Bitcoin protocol and program the node logic, but AI won't be able to create gold

AI will also need to gold for the signal connectors in the electronics that the AI runs on

It's chemistry/physics vs computer code. You can write new code, but you can't create new Au (without it being very, very expensive)</p>

        <p>Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin

TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.

Bitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. 

While gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.

Gold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.

Electronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. 

Digital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them

This is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition</p>

        <p>silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend

this represents a ≈27% correction from the top

this is the lowest possible bottom for this move - it probably won't go this low. if it does, the move will happen fast, so have your buy limit orders ready. next week is FOMC interest rate decision. the Fed will cut the rates by another 25bps, and other things equal - it's positive price pressure for silver

if the price breaks below $47, it will likely fall closer to $45. expect a stronger support in the $43-45 area

overall, any prices in the vicinity of September 15th 2025 prices is a GREAT buying opportunity

* keep in mind the total 75 bps interest rate cut by the Fed this year is already in progress of being priced in - the market doesn't wait for the official announcement. this is one of the reasons why you had so much upside price volatility in the last month</p>

            <p>1 month ago I wrote that silver could extend its current move to ≈60% from the ≈$34.5 price level

silver topped exactly there at ≈$54.5

now my next notes:

treat the pullback and any price consolidation action as a buying opportunity

during the next 6 months long positions entered in this area will be in profit. likely sooner, but 180 days provides a higher confidence timeline</p>

        <p>1 month ago I wrote that silver could extend its current move to ≈60% from the ≈$34.5 price level

silver topped exactly there at ≈$54.5

now my next notes:

treat the pullback and any price consolidation action as a buying opportunity

during the next 6 months long positions entered in this area will be in profit. likely sooner, but 180 days provides a higher confidence timeline</p>

            <p>silver's current move is already up >25%. it's better to have a pullback somewhere around the current level

it can move up even further, extending the total move to ≈60%, but then you’ll get a larger and longer lasting pull back

when silver moves in smaller increments, it has shorter-lasting consolidations/pullbacks. so this is what i mean by "better"</p>

        <p>gold has formed a double top on the 4H chart 📈 

that's why I wrote that buy orders below the current prices are a good idea

i'd prioritize buying opportunities in silver + gold & silver miners on this pullback

gold is also a great idea, but you'll get more volatility/relative upside in others</p>

        <p>Bitcoin isn't private - at best it's anonymous

and this is by design. it's just cryptography/math - not much to argue about

but gold transactions aren't private either. most of the time they're not even anonymous. you must have some level of trust with the counterparty - either directly or via intermediary. a lot of the times this is required by law

at retail level, there is much more privacy and anonymity with Bitcoin that with gold

gold has clearly more intrinsic value than bitcoin, but bitcoin is one of the most significant advancements in money. although bitcoin isn't money 😄</p>
