        <p>what's up with the "urging" the Fed to cut by 50 bps today?

the rate cut is known NOW - and it will be no more & no less than 25 bps/0.25%. there is absolutely nothing to speculate about here

i assure you that your urges won't affect what the market already priced in 😄</p>

        <p>these dynamics create an incentive for further upward price pressure:

➖ purchase prices raise due to low rates and ample financing

if the FOMC members suggest rates lower than in the June 2025 - expect an upwards rally in assets

        <p>the financial system infrastructure, including monetary policies of the central banks are correlated

they're heavily exposed to the same set of assets - a lot of which are USD-denominated

this is of course extremely pro-cyclical</p>

≈25% if you count from the tariffs announcements on April 7th

            <p>🇪🇺 The best countermeasure that EU can take is swapping US securities for Gold

Gold is inversely correlated with USD. Such a decision can be done today and it will:

1️⃣be a response to the US
2️⃣increase value of EUR
3️⃣minimize consumer impact

Anything else will hurt the economy</p>
