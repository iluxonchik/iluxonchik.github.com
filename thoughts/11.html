        <p>Of course - context is always needed

In 2002 Fed Funds Rate was x3 smaller

At that time, rates were higher overall

To find rates as small as in 2002, you’d need to go back to the 1960's 😳

For 15 years now, US had effectively been under QE financing - cheap debt

        <p>🤯 The year is 2002…

US bond yields are at the same high levels as they were in 2002… That’s 23 years ago

In 2002 US national debt was x6 SMALLER than now

5.1% now is not the same as 5.1% before - it’s worse. Much more debt to refinance & pay interest</p>

        <p>🇷🇺 Russian Bond Yield Curve Is Inverted

An inverted yield curve is usually a bad sign (e.g. recession)

However, 🇷🇺's fundamentals are healthy

Why inverted? 🇷🇺 Central Bank's 21% key interest rate, or rather the expectation of it going down, is what’s pushing this shape</p>

        <p>Here's why bond yields skyrocketing worldwide ⬇️

Countries own a lot of US debt (bonds)
Moody's downgraded the US credit rating

Now, countries are at a higher risk of default, because the US debt they own is now less valuable = higher chance of country's default

Outflows into equities

However, some gold-linked currencies like Ruble are up 2.5%
