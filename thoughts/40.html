Gold doesn't need Bitcoin", "articleBody": "Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn't need Bitcoin\n\nTL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.\n\nBitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. \n\nWhile gold isn't strictly required for electronics, it's widely used to due to organic demand. Gold's ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold's intrinsic value.\n\nGold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.\n\nElectronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won't be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. \n\nDigital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn't have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them\n\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/bitcoin-needs-gold-gold-doesnt-need-bitcoin.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-22T08:41:30+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/097682b6-14c6-56c5-a661-f1c31964f071.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend", "articleBody": "silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend\n\nthis represents a ≈27% correction from the top\n\nthis is the lowest possible bottom for this move -

This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago\n\nSo using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today's USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it's useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold's USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.\n\nWill Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form. Gold (Au) hasn't changed in 13 billion years\n\nBitcoin promo accounts love to compare BTC to gold, and they frequently cite that BTC is up much more than gold over the last 16 years. The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent\n\nWhat the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived. As such, such comparisons fail short\n\nThey also seem to selectively omit the massive volatility - gold doesn't go down 80% every other day/cycle top\n\nThe gold prices here I computed are estimates - don't take them as hard quantitive data.

        <p>Bitcoin needs gold. Gold doesn&#x27;t need Bitcoin<br><br>TL;DR: Bitcoin is a protocol that runs on computers. Computers rely heavily on electronics. Gold is widely used in electronics. Bitcoin depends on gold.<br><br>Bitcoin quite literally runs on gold. ≈99% of physical machines hosting Bitcoin nodes contain at least trace amounts of gold. The same is true for the overall electric grid infrastructure that delivers electricity to Bitcoin nodes. <br><br>While gold isn&#x27;t strictly required for electronics, it&#x27;s widely used to due to organic demand. Gold&#x27;s ROI in signal connectors is very strong, because you need little gold to mitigate a large amount of failure risk. All of this is due to the unique chemical nature of gold, which alongside its scarcity is at the base of gold&#x27;s intrinsic value.<br><br>Gold is a chemical element in the periodic table - its atomic symbol is Au. Physical gold is essentially Au atoms connected to other Au atoms in a cubic pattern. This structure is very stable, and at the same time soft/malleable. Gold is used in electronics because it provides stable, low and predictable contact resistance and corrosion immunity at low currents/voltages, including under vibration.<br><br>Electronics is of course just one of the use-cases of gold. Among others, it has been used as money for more than 5000 years. Even if Bitcoin does become money in the future, it won&#x27;t be the only form of money (plus, you can always tokenize gold!). And especially not for the near long-term future. <br><br>Digital currencies are at their infancy, and they almost always depend on stable electrical grid and network connection to function properly. This includes Bitcoin. Gold doesn&#x27;t have this risk. It was used as money before electricity and networks existed, and it can continue to be used alongside them<br><br>This is not to say that Bitcoin is a bad idea, but gold has a higher intrinsic value by definition</p>

        <p>silver could pullback to ≈$40 before continuing its uptrend<br><br>this represents a ≈27% correction from the top<br><br>this is the lowest possible bottom for this move - it probably won&#x27;t go this low. if it does, the move will happen fast, so have your buy limit orders ready. next week is FOMC interest rate decision. the Fed will cut the rates by another 25bps, and other things equal - it&#x27;s positive price pressure for silver<br><br>if the price breaks below $47, it will likely fall closer to $45. expect a stronger support in the $43-45 area<br><br>overall, any prices in the vicinity of September 15th 2025 prices is a GREAT buying opportunity<br><br>* keep in mind the total 75 bps interest rate cut by the Fed this year is already in progress of being priced in - the market doesn&#x27;t wait for the official announcement. this is one of the reasons why you had so much upside price volatility in the last month</p>

        <p>my vibe meter on Bitcoin is off the charts 📈*<br><br>the algorithm on X has been pushing a lot of pro-BTC content over the past month, and it&#x27;s becoming more and more irrational: <br><br>accounts with millions of followers recycling 2024 news about &quot;new&quot; gold reserves in China, false news about China legalizing Bitcoin and calls for gold going down to $2000<br><br>every pro-Bitcoin account seems to be calling a long-term gold top (LOL!) and heavy rotation into Bitcoin. actually a lot of BTC shill content is about BTC being better than gold - and the arguments for it aren&#x27;t very sound. i&#x27;ve written several posts explaining this. BTC crowd seems very obsessed about gold - especially when it comes to showing how it&#x27;s inferior to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not gold - and it will never be gold - they&#x27;re very different assets. that doesn&#x27;t mean that BTC ownership is a bad idea - but it&#x27;s important important to approach it rationally <br><br>a large part of this seems coordinated/paid campaigns. liquidity always needs an exit<br><br>so Bitcoin should continue with some more downside in the near future<br><br>* this sentiment is based on vibes, but it&#x27;s backed by technicals &amp; fundamentals at its base. you can find in-depth explanations in my past posts and threads</p>

        <p>BTC went from $0.004 to $110,000 USD in 16 years, but gold was never this cheap in over 5000 years<br><br>Going back to the start of recorded price systems - gold&#x27;s starting price per gram is ≈100 days of labor! This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago<br><br>So using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today&#x27;s USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it&#x27;s useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold&#x27;s USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.<br><br>Will Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form. Gold (Au) hasn&#x27;t changed in 13 billion years<br><br>Bitcoin promo accounts love to compare BTC to gold, and they frequently cite that BTC is up much more than gold over the last 16 years. The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent<br><br>What the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived. As such, such comparisons fail short<br><br>They also seem to selectively omit the massive volatility - gold doesn&#x27;t go down 80% every other day/cycle top<br><br>The gold prices here I computed are estimates - don&#x27;t take them as hard quantitive data. Read this in the context of comparing the price of gold and Bitcoin. If someone&#x27;s argument is that Bitcoin is better than gold because it had a higher percentual return in 16 years - it likely lacks substance</p>

Digital currency designs existed before bitcoin - and double spending wasn&#x27;t an unsolvable problem<br><br>3.
