        <p>This is definitely good news short-term for the USD!

Today, short-term funding got 1.25% cheaper for the US government, and once the FED lowers the interest rates, the yields will fall more. Now ofc this will lead to inflation & devaluation of USD, but that's a a different story</p>

        <p>Look at that liquidity moving from short-term Chinese bonds(CN01Y), to short-term US bonds(US02Y) 👀

The market liked the removal of tariffs, however, you can't undo the massive volatility over the past 2 weeks

Moreover, US Dollar index is still below 100</p>

Lower interest rates on the other hand - a flourishing economy

What GPT-o1 failed to mention is that higher interest rates promote savings - a non-inflationary demand

        <p>Yuan downside party really didn't last 😳

It went up just as fast as it went down

Yuan up + falling yields on Chinese bonds builds a positive outlook for renminbi

The hinted US securities liquidation/purchase pause by Chinese banks also contributed to this

All expected 🤷‍♀️</p>

2. What 😂

Imagine swapping a part of the peg of the US Dollar - the world reserve currency - from gold to a highly volatile asset

        <p>Regarding the bond market collapse ⬇️

US Treasury Securities are the main collateral used in repurchase agreements. Given that these are short-term, the yield spike is unlikely to lead to defaults

However, the fall in bond prices will reduce credit, adding to liquidity crunch</p>

        <p>Another important fact to mention regarding Russia, is that on top of sell-off of US securities & loading up on gold in record numbers, throughout 2025 Central Bank of Russia has kept interest rates at 21% 🤯

Result = massive savings

However, if EU or US did the same - their economies would collapse overnight</p>

        <p>It gets crazier 🤯

In the past 3 months, amids the tariff madness - at the time of rush into safe assets - Ruble & Gold head-to-head

You could've either bought gold or Ruble & gained 18% in both cases

And buying ruble isn't easy due to sanctions. Imagine when it opens up</p>

        <p>Ruble is a gold success story ✨

Sanctions, tariffs, raising M2 - it doesn't care

Central Bank Of Russia sold off their US bonds & loaded up on gold

⬇️ US bond prices are down
⬆️ Gold is up
⬆️ Ruble is up against USD

Expect this playbook to be repeated by others</p>

It has now reached COVID-levels

Combine they with the bond sell off, the falling dollar index & you get a worrying picture

The stock market will rebounce/inflate, but that will increase the premium for debt refinancing over time</p>

Just look at NASDAQ, S&P500 & Co

Every time I open TradingView it's a +-5%

Maybe more regulations will solve this? 😁</p>
