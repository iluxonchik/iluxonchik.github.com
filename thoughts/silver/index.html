"articleBody": "Silver Mining Stocks Are Undervalued In 2026\n\n*Below is my 5-minute analysis on silver miners equity prices for 2026\n\nThe price ratio of silver miners to silver is at some of its lowest levels in history, roughly at the same values as it was in the 2000’s. The ratio is currently sitting on a support from 2014-2015 inside of a multi-year upward price channel. Alongside the macroeconomic and geopolitical fundamentals, this setup’s potential upside gain justifies the limited downside risk. Unless silver experiences a large medium-to-longterm pullback, silver mining equity prices are set to increase against the price of silver. For this to happen, there are 3 high-level scenarios:\n\n1️⃣ Silver price remains above ≈$88: silver miners appreciate more than silver\n\n2️⃣ Silver price remains above ≈$83: silver falls in price, miners fall less or increase\n\n3️⃣ Silver price remains above ≈$70: silver falls in price, miners fall less (more likely) or increase\n\nGiven the increasing demand for physical silver combined with currency debasement driven by refinancing needs, I don’t believe silver’s spot price will experience a pullback to lower than the ≈$70 level in 2026. Pullbacks below ≈$70 are more likely to trigger a larger sell-off in silver miners, potentially even pushing the ratio further down, meaning that silver mining stocks fall in price more than silver.\n\nSilver producers/miners, royalty and streamers can be a great source of diversification and even \"hedging\" of your silver investments without ever leaving the commodities sector. You can further diversify your exposure to other metals by acquiring fund units and/or equities in producers, royalty and streamers that focus on more than two metals (e.g. there are companies mining gold, silver and copper).\n\nA few days ago, I wrote a post about how gold miner prices are set to breakout. But silver is not gold. Silver miners will be more volatile than gold miners, but given a positive correlation between gold and silver prices, they will tend to follow the gold miner’s direction. After all, most gold mining companies mine silver and vice-versa (silver is often mined as a byproduct of other metals like gold, copper, lead and zinc). The attached chart shows the ratio between the price of Hecla Mining and Pan American Silver, so it doesn’t include all silver miners, but you’ll find a similar structure in silver equity-based indices against the spot/futures price of the metal.\n\nIn the longer timespan (e.g. 3+ years), miners may underperform the underlying metal. This analysis is written with a focus on the current price levels with a timeframe of 1 year from now. Given that this article was written in January 2026, you can consider this as a guide for the remainder of 2026. Physical silver is not the same as silver miners. The mining sector is exposed to an array of risks distinct from the metal, with the highest one currently being the geopolitical risk in the form of armed conflict (destruction, supply chain disruption) and legal changes (sanctions, tariffs, export/import limits). Thus, even if the price of the physical metal goes up, miners price can collapse. The same risks can put upwards pressure on the metal and downward pressure on the miners simultaneously. I don't believe these risks will materialize sufficiently for miners by the end of 2026, and given the upside price pressure on commodities, miners will also ride that price wave up.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/silver-mining-stocks-are-undervalued-in-2026", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/silver-mining-stocks-are-undervalued-in-2026", "datePublished": "2026-01-18T14:41:36+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-18T14:41:36+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/silver-mining-stocks-are-undervalued-in-2026.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "So silver didn't top for the cycle, 2011 didn't repeat and instead less than 2 weeks later it hit another all...", "articleBody": "So silver didn't top for the cycle, 2011 didn't repeat and instead less than 2 weeks later it hit another all time high\n\nImagine my surprise 😄\n\nMore all time highs are coming and, as I've written before, you can safely ignore any calls for long-term top.\n\nYou can't find a top on chart without understanding what drives the price on that chart in the first place.

(≈$640M) per year as budget for the \"acquisition of state reserves of precious metals and precious stones\".\n\nSilver falls explicitly under the definition of \"precious metals\". More specifically, under Russian framework law № 41-ФЗ the term \"precious metals\" (\"драгоценные металлы\") is explicitly defined as gold, silver, platinum and the metals of the platinum group.\n\nIn addition to the above, in the official explanatory note (пояснительная записка) to the draft of Federal Law № 419-ФЗ the Russian Ministry of Finance explicitly states that the plan is to acquire refined gold, refined silver, refined platinum and refined palladium for strategic goals. More specifically, the aim is to increase the share of \"highly liquid valuables\" in the State Fund of Precious Metals and Precious Stones of the Russian Federation (Госфонд России).", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/russia-will-buy-silver-as-a-strategic-reserve-until-2027", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/russia-will-buy-silver-as-a-strategic-reserve-until-2027", "datePublished": "2025-11-14T19:14:59+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-14T19:14:59+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/russia-will-buy-silver-as-a-strategic-reserve-until-2027.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "As I've written earlier today, Silver will encounter corrections", "articleBody": "As I've written earlier today, Silver will encounter corrections\n\nThese are all buying opportunities - as is the whole price range within current larger pullback.

        <p>Today&#x27;s Commodity Miners Sell-Off Is A Buying Opportunity<br><br>I&#x27;ve made numerous such calls in the past, and they were correct 100% of the time. Today, I&#x27;m making one of such calls again.<br><br>Gold, silver and copper miners are down today, with indices and individual large caps falling by as much as ≈8%, despite the underlying metals remaining in the green. This is exactly the situation where you can leverage the increased volatility in the mining sector to increase your exposure to the underlying metals during an uptrend.<br><br>I expect the prices of gold and silver miners indices to increase by ≈30% from current levels within roughly 10 trading weeks from now. It may happen sooner than though - pay close attention to the price action.<br><br>It&#x27;s also possible for the price to dip lower than the current levels before the upwards move described above materializes. This mainly depends on the price action of the precious and industrial metals in the next few weeks, but I don&#x27;t believe that either one of them has topped for the cycle, thus uptrend resumption is imminent.<br><br>I&#x27;ve written several articles explaining why commodities and commodity miners are a great investment for 2026. I suggest you to read them if you haven&#x27;t done so yet.</p>

        <p>Silver Mining Stocks Are Undervalued In 2026<br><br>*Below is my 5-minute analysis on silver miners equity prices for 2026<br><br>The price ratio of silver miners to silver is at some of its lowest levels in history, roughly at the same values as it was in the 2000’s. The ratio is currently sitting on a support from 2014-2015 inside of a multi-year upward price channel. Alongside the macroeconomic and geopolitical fundamentals, this setup’s potential upside gain justifies the limited downside risk. Unless silver experiences a large medium-to-longterm pullback, silver mining equity prices are set to increase against the price of silver. For this to happen, there are 3 high-level scenarios:<br><br>1️⃣ Silver price remains above ≈$88: silver miners appreciate more than silver<br><br>2️⃣ Silver price remains above ≈$83: silver falls in price, miners fall less or increase<br><br>3️⃣ Silver price remains above ≈$70: silver falls in price, miners fall less (more likely) or increase<br><br>Given the increasing demand for physical silver combined with currency debasement driven by refinancing needs, I don’t believe silver’s spot price will experience a pullback to lower than the ≈$70 level in 2026. Pullbacks below ≈$70 are more likely to trigger a larger sell-off in silver miners, potentially even pushing the ratio further down, meaning that silver mining stocks fall in price more than silver.<br><br>Silver producers/miners, royalty and streamers can be a great source of diversification and even &quot;hedging&quot; of your silver investments without ever leaving the commodities sector. You can further diversify your exposure to other metals by acquiring fund units and/or equities in producers, royalty and streamers that focus on more than two metals (e.g. there are companies mining gold, silver and copper).<br><br>A few days ago, I wrote a post about how gold miner prices are set to breakout. But silver is not gold. Silver miners will be more volatile than gold miners, but given a positive correlation between gold and silver prices, they will tend to follow the gold miner’s direction. After all, most gold mining companies mine silver and vice-versa (silver is often mined as a byproduct of other metals like gold, copper, lead and zinc). The attached chart shows the ratio between the price of Hecla Mining and Pan American Silver, so it doesn’t include all silver miners, but you’ll find a similar structure in silver equity-based indices against the spot/futures price of the metal.<br><br>In the longer timespan (e.g. 3+ years), miners may underperform the underlying metal. This analysis is written with a focus on the current price levels with a timeframe of 1 year from now. Given that this article was written in January 2026, you can consider this as a guide for the remainder of 2026. Physical silver is not the same as silver miners. The mining sector is exposed to an array of risks distinct from the metal, with the highest one currently being the geopolitical risk in the form of armed conflict (destruction, supply chain disruption) and legal changes (sanctions, tariffs, export/import limits). Thus, even if the price of the physical metal goes up, miners price can collapse. The same risks can put upwards pressure on the metal and downward pressure on the miners simultaneously. I don&#x27;t believe these risks will materialize sufficiently for miners by the end of 2026, and given the upside price pressure on commodities, miners will also ride that price wave up.</p>
