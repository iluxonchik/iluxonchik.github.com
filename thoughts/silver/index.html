    <div class="thought-content">
        <p>Russia will buy Silver as a strategic reserve until 2027<br><br>I&#x27;m not speculating on anything, this comes directly from the Russian legislation, namely the Federal Law № 419-ФЗ (in Russian/cyrilic: Федеральный закон от 30 ноября 2024 г. № 419-ФЗ) whose budget tables for 2025–2027 allocate ≈51.5 billion rubles (≈$640M) per year as budget for the &quot;acquisition of state reserves of precious metals and precious stones&quot;.<br><br>Silver falls explicitly under the definition of &quot;precious metals&quot;. More specifically, under Russian framework law № 41-ФЗ the term &quot;precious metals&quot; (&quot;драгоценные металлы&quot;) is explicitly defined as gold, silver, platinum and the metals of the platinum group.<br><br>In addition to the above, in the official explanatory note (пояснительная записка) to the draft of Federal Law № 419-ФЗ the Russian Ministry of Finance explicitly states that the plan is to acquire refined gold, refined silver, refined platinum and refined palladium for strategic goals. More specifically, the aim is to increase the share of &quot;highly liquid valuables&quot; in the State Fund of Precious Metals and Precious Stones of the Russian Federation (Госфонд России).</p>

        <p>no, &quot;The West&quot; is not manipulating gold and silver prices<br><br>silver and gold had retracements many times before, but I guess when it falls on Chinese holidays it becomes &quot;western manipulation&quot;?<br><br>≈32% of global gold demand in 2025 comes from China (estimate for jewelry + bar &amp; coin). China is a major buyer of gold - so a lot of demand there<br><br>a more reasonable explanation is a demand dip, due to the holiday in PRC. also the US government shutdown. although I agree the idea of a magic red button saying DUMP GOLD located somewhere in the west is more exciting 😄<br><br>it&#x27;s also not clear what would be the purpose of manipulating the price of gold down, as that would be benefiting China - they can buy it cheaper!<br><br>PBoC has been buying gold for years, and they will continue to do so. PBoC doesn&#x27;t announce targets publicly - and they&#x27;re flexible on their purchases, so again, lowering the gold price would likely allow them to buy it at a cheaper price</p>
