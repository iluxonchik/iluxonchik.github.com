Neither self-driving cars, nor inference about financial data primarily rely on generative models. Perhaps you can have LLM program that logic on the go, but that would require the LLM to effectively dominate those tasks (i.e. effectively become good at driving a car and being able to build sound financial models via a programming language), and given the probabilistic nature of the inference I don’t think we can have LLMs and agents fully taking over these critical areas. Regarding the probabilistic nature, I’m specifically referring the unsecured/unparameterized probability - it’s hard to modulate the potential error.\n\nRight now, agent setups are very good at boilerplate, repeatable code - and most of the code is like that. Most of software development is already abstracted by various frameworks, and a lot of the softwares do very similar tasks and are implemented in similar ways, following specific patterns. Anecdotally, think of a generic SaaS - there are several competing products that do basically the same thing, because they solve a common problem. Agents/LLMs are already great at predicting code of which they have a lot of examples in their training set. This alone, is a massive productivity boost, especially if you are prototyping/iterating.\n\nTo give a more concrete answer, the current tech would probably top out at multi-agent, multi-model and some form of DSL(s). So you would have multiple agents, some of them using distinct models. For example, one model for planning, another model for writing code, another model for debugging, etc. The DSLs would be used for both: customizing agents and models (input) and the model would output the code in a DSL (output). So when you ask the model to generate code, it would output it in a higher-level programming language/DSL, and then that one would either be compiled down/translated into a different target, wether that is machine code or a programming language like Python. The DSL design would be optimized for this “generative development” - in practice it will make things like math-induced security issues more difficult for LLMs to make (e.g. the DSL forces the LLM to use pre-defined cryptographic primitives, and at compilation time type metadata is associated to enforce its correct usage across schemes). So at this tech’s peak, the LLMs probably won’t be outputting their code in directly Python. I don’t mean that this is the peak for generative models or ML field as a whole, but for the current state of the tech and the approaches it uses.\n\nBefore the tech tops out, however, I think there will be a security issue at scale, followed by an increased focus on security of agents and the the inferred code. Since many products will be using the same models to generate code, the same flawed security patterns will arise in many places, and it will be “easy” to exploit them at scale. Even with detailed instructions, SOTA models still generate vulnerabilities. Even though most of the code is fine, it takes one small issue in a sensitive place to compromise the system - and if you write any non-trivial code with LLMs, you will run into them. I’ve encountered a lot of this issues myself, and in the code that I’ve reviewed from other developers who wrote their code with LLMs. Proper context helps a lot, but it doesn’t resolve the probabilistic nature of the output.\n\nRegarding getting closer to human-like functionality, it will almost certainly require other ML schemes/approaches in addition to what we have now and further refining and combination of existing approaches. I think we will soon go into meta-models, where a model internally uses other models/sub models to produce the output (in its simplest form, think of a random forest that “choses” the most appropriate sub-model to run or the output which one of the sub-model’s outputs to use for the next step) - this can help mitigate some of the risks arising from the probabilistic nature of the inference. That would require coordinated, specialized agents, powered by meta-models.\n\nWhere I think we have a lot to still to gain with the current tech, even if its progress freezes, is education. LLMs provide a novel way to interact with digital information, you can do it in the same way that you would interact with another human - via spoken language. Being able to formulate your very specific questions, in your very specific way and usually getting a correct answer to it still amazes me to this day. If you combine generative models with VR, you get a whole new dimension of experiencing information, allowing to learn more effectively.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/no-agi-with-llms-in-their-current-form", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/no-agi-with-llms-in-their-current-form", "datePublished": "2026-02-05T17:07:46+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-02-05T17:07:46+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/illya_gerasymchuk_thoughts.webp"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "AI will follow a much more logarithmic growth than the hype may lead you to believe", "articleBody": "AI will follow a much more logarithmic growth than the hype may lead you to believe\n\nWe've been perpetually '6 months away from AGI', yet as amazing the SOTA generative models are - we're no where near that.\n\nI don't believe that the current generative ML architectures will be enough to deliver the promises even over the next decade.

However, it's important to be aware of its limits.\n\nVibe/agent coding for critical systems doesn't work well (yet).\n\nYou'll also be disappointed if you're trying to do something with financial markets (e.g. Machine-Learning based models).\n\nVibe coded apps also frequently come with security vulnerabilities (for many apps this may be an acceptable compromise).\n\nI don't think you'd be comfortable with driving a vehicle with all of its software vibe-coded, or with all code written by an agentic system, without thorough human investment.\n\nLLMs are good at solving problems that have been solved many time before, but this abstraction quickly breaks apart if you delve with them into less developed topics, which frequent tend to be more complex. Pattern matching based prediction is very powerful, but you need enough patterns to learn from, alongside the correct context.\n\nAdditionally, vibe-coding a large codebase is one thing, while maintaining that same codebase is another.\n\nAutopilot in commercial airplanes didn't deprecate carbon-based human pilots, but it did deprecate pilots who didn't commit to learning and integrating autopilot during the flight.\n\nSo is programming really dead, or has it merely evolved? 🤔", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/llms-ai-agents-didnt-replace-programming-they-evolved-it", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/llms-ai-agents-didnt-replace-programming-they-evolved-it", "datePublished": "2026-01-02T15:09:45+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-02T15:09:45+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/illya_gerasymchuk_thoughts.webp"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website", "articleBody": "Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website\n\nYou can now filter my articles by topic at https://illya.sh/threads/topics/\n\nQwen3-Embedding-0.6B is used to vectorize and embed all of the articles/threads, which are then tagged/categorized based on natural language tags for the category.\nThis allows me to define a new category by defining a new Python class with the topic/category name, description, URL path, and the query sting to embed and query against the thread embeddings.

        <p>No AGI With LLMs In Their Current Form.<br><br>Generative models are just one type of models in ML. Neither self-driving cars, nor inference about financial data primarily rely on generative models. Perhaps you can have LLM program that logic on the go, but that would require the LLM to effectively dominate those tasks (i.e. effectively become good at driving a car and being able to build sound financial models via a programming language), and given the probabilistic nature of the inference I don’t think we can have LLMs and agents fully taking over these critical areas. Regarding the probabilistic nature, I’m specifically referring the unsecured/unparameterized probability - it’s hard to modulate the potential error.<br><br>Right now, agent setups are very good at boilerplate, repeatable code - and most of the code is like that. Most of software development is already abstracted by various frameworks, and a lot of the softwares do very similar tasks and are implemented in similar ways, following specific patterns. Anecdotally, think of a generic SaaS - there are several competing products that do basically the same thing, because they solve a common problem. Agents/LLMs are already great at predicting code of which they have a lot of examples in their training set. This alone, is a massive productivity boost, especially if you are prototyping/iterating.<br><br>To give a more concrete answer, the current tech would probably top out at multi-agent, multi-model and some form of DSL(s). So you would have multiple agents, some of them using distinct models. For example, one model for planning, another model for writing code, another model for debugging, etc. The DSLs would be used for both: customizing agents and models (input) and the model would output the code in a DSL (output). So when you ask the model to generate code, it would output it in a higher-level programming language/DSL, and then that one would either be compiled down/translated into a different target, wether that is machine code or a programming language like Python. The DSL design would be optimized for this “generative development” - in practice it will make things like math-induced security issues more difficult for LLMs to make (e.g. the DSL forces the LLM to use pre-defined cryptographic primitives, and at compilation time type metadata is associated to enforce its correct usage across schemes). So at this tech’s peak, the LLMs probably won’t be outputting their code in directly Python. I don’t mean that this is the peak for generative models or ML field as a whole, but for the current state of the tech and the approaches it uses.<br><br>Before the tech tops out, however, I think there will be a security issue at scale, followed by an increased focus on security of agents and the the inferred code. Since many products will be using the same models to generate code, the same flawed security patterns will arise in many places, and it will be “easy” to exploit them at scale. Even with detailed instructions, SOTA models still generate vulnerabilities. Even though most of the code is fine, it takes one small issue in a sensitive place to compromise the system - and if you write any non-trivial code with LLMs, you will run into them. I’ve encountered a lot of this issues myself, and in the code that I’ve reviewed from other developers who wrote their code with LLMs. Proper context helps a lot, but it doesn’t resolve the probabilistic nature of the output.<br><br>Regarding getting closer to human-like functionality, it will almost certainly require other ML schemes/approaches in addition to what we have now and further refining and combination of existing approaches. I think we will soon go into meta-models, where a model internally uses other models/sub models to produce the output (in its simplest form, think of a random forest that “choses” the most appropriate sub-model to run or the output which one of the sub-model’s outputs to use for the next step) - this can help mitigate some of the risks arising from the probabilistic nature of the inference. That would require coordinated, specialized agents, powered by meta-models.<br><br>Where I think we have a lot to still to gain with the current tech, even if its progress freezes, is education. LLMs provide a novel way to interact with digital information, you can do it in the same way that you would interact with another human - via spoken language. Being able to formulate your very specific questions, in your very specific way and usually getting a correct answer to it still amazes me to this day. If you combine generative models with VR, you get a whole new dimension of experiencing information, allowing to learn more effectively.</p>

        <p>AI will follow a much more logarithmic growth than the hype may lead you to believe<br><br>We&#x27;ve been perpetually &#x27;6 months away from AGI&#x27;, yet as amazing the SOTA generative models are - we&#x27;re no where near that.<br><br>I don&#x27;t believe that the current generative ML architectures will be enough to deliver the promises even over the next decade. Generative models have their limits.<br><br>There&#x27;s also a massive AI bubble in the U.S., wit the same entities over promising on results directly benefiting from public funds, which get counted as revenue many times over. Maybe this need a new term like, rerevenuezation (like rehypothecation with bonds) 😄<br><br>With that said, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re anywhere near the full benefits just from the tech we have available up to today.

        <p>LLMs &amp; AI Agents Didn&#x27;t Replace Programming - They Evolved It<br><br>I&#x27;ve been programming with LLMs since 2022, implementing systems of varied complexity, both professionally and exploratory/hobby projects. And I will continue to do so in 2026. However, it&#x27;s important to be aware of its limits.<br><br>Vibe/agent coding for critical systems doesn&#x27;t work well (yet).<br><br>You&#x27;ll also be disappointed if you&#x27;re trying to do something with financial markets (e.g. Machine-Learning based models).<br><br>Vibe coded apps also frequently come with security vulnerabilities (for many apps this may be an acceptable compromise).<br><br>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be comfortable with driving a vehicle with all of its software vibe-coded, or with all code written by an agentic system, without thorough human investment.<br><br>LLMs are good at solving problems that have been solved many time before, but this abstraction quickly breaks apart if you delve with them into less developed topics, which frequent tend to be more complex. Pattern matching based prediction is very powerful, but you need enough patterns to learn from, alongside the correct context.<br><br>Additionally, vibe-coding a large codebase is one thing, while maintaining that same codebase is another.<br><br>Autopilot in commercial airplanes didn&#x27;t deprecate carbon-based human pilots, but it did deprecate pilots who didn&#x27;t commit to learning and integrating autopilot during the flight.<br><br>So is programming really dead, or has it merely evolved? 🤔</p>

        <p>Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website<br><br>You can now filter my articles by topic at <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/topics/" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/topics/</a><br><br>Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is used to vectorize and embed all of the articles/threads, which are then tagged/categorized based on natural language tags for the category.<br>This allows me to define a new category by defining a new Python class with the topic/category name, description, URL path, and the query sting to embed and query against the thread embeddings. From there, all of the content is generated statically. <br><br>Everything runs 100% locally/offline. Model weights are pre-downloaded once - that&#x27;s the most time-consuming part. <br><br>The motivation for implementing this has to with the content&#x27;s volume. I have written over 180 articles/threads, but until now there was no categorization. So if you wanted to read an article on a particular topic, you&#x27;d either have to google it, ask an LLM or go through the list manually yourself. Now, there is an index with topics, which help navigating the content semantically.<br><br>Navigate to <a href="https://t.co/bXb1JWKD4d," target="_blank">https://t.co/bXb1JWKD4d,</a> select a topic, and you will be presented paginated list of all threads/articles matching that topic.</p>
