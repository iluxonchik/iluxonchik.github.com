        <p>🇷🇺 Russian Bond Yield Curve Is Inverted

An inverted yield curve is usually a bad sign (e.g. recession)

However, 🇷🇺's fundamentals are healthy

Why inverted? 🇷🇺 Central Bank's 21% key interest rate, or rather the expectation of it going down, is what's pushing this shape</p>

        <p>Here's why bond yields skyrocketing worldwide ⬇️

Countries own a lot of US debt (bonds)
Moody's downgraded the US credit rating

Now, countries are at a higher risk of default, because the US debt they own is now less valuable = higher chance of country's default

(simplified)</p>

        <p>Btw I've since learned that gold is only ≈10% of total reserves of the Portuguese Central bank - that's low

It's 80% of their international reserves - those are basically regulation-defined ratios that banks must maintain (look into BASEL rules if curious)</p>

        <p>Ever since I wrote this about Japan's easing monetary policy - the yields on 🇯🇵 30 year bonds are up more than x2

Japan heavily relies on debt. Today, Japan has to pay 123% more for that debt than they did 2 years ago

1️⃣ Default
2️⃣ Inflate Yen

Last time yields were consistently this high was 2007. But a lot of QE policies came in force after the 2007-2011 crisis, so rates were naturally higher back then</p>

        <p>How does the Russian government get the oil & gas revenue?

👉 Heavy taxation 👈

So no matter if you're public or private - you pay for per extracted unit of natural resource

This income is directly tied to the budget & NWF - which is then debited or credited, base on target</p>

        <p>🇷🇺 TIL Russia has a National Wealth Fund

Excess oil & gas profits are credited to NWF

NWF funds are used to finance government deficit, instead of relying on debt issuance of Ruble (government bonds). Inflation-free deficit financing

🇪🇺 We need this in the EU for Euro</p>
