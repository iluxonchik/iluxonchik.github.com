For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank‚Äôs counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled \"when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money\": \nhttps://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html \n\nI received a question about it via e-mail, so I‚Äôm writing a follow-up with clarifications.\n\nThe flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let‚Äôs assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let‚Äôs forget about US government bonds for now, let‚Äôs say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ‚âà$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let‚Äôs also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)\n\nLet‚Äôs say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn‚Äôt exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else‚Äôs account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created ‚Äúout of thin air‚Äù, and that money was credited into your account. I say ‚Äúcredited‚Äù because it‚Äôs from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.\n\nNow, I referred to ‚Äúmoney in circulation‚Äù, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn‚Äôt touch the broader economy directly.\n\nIf instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.\n\nIn the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of ‚Äúnew money‚Äù - the money moves within the central bank‚Äôs reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank‚Äôs reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  \n\nThe following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758915714.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758915714.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-26T19:41:54+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-26T19:41:54+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/1d71ac4e-52bc-52f2-a5e0-4223f54477db.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "you can read the full article/thread explaining why September is generally a bad month for Bitcoin and other‚Ä¶", "articleBody": "you can read the full article/thread explaining why September is generally a bad month for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies here: https://illya.sh/threads/@1755867104-1.html", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758828006.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758828006.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T19:20:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T19:20:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/79345246-1233-50fe-9e6d-1e921abfef95.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "my article on repo rates and BTC price was referenced on bitcoin.com", "articleBody": "my article on repo rates and BTC price was referenced on bitcoin.com\n\napparently it's been there for a month, but i only noticed now\n\nit's a short read - and explains the negative price pressure that quarter-ends, and  especially September bring on the price of liquidity sensitive assets like Bitcoin\n\nit give you a concrete perspective on the current cryptocurrency price dump, even with decreasing funding rates", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758827526.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758827526.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T19:12:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T19:12:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/a61dd4da-545a-5074-86fb-eb0cef0931f5.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "even if silver goes down to $30/oz it will still be in an uptrend ü§Ø", "articleBody": "even if silver goes down to $30/oz it will still be in an uptrend ü§Ø\n\n(weekly chart)", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758800466.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/@1758800466.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T11:41:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T11:41:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/cc570728-8faf-5e4b-912e-4ad76847b414.jpg"}]}

        <p>neither supply nor demand are static

if you renew a building in a high demand area you're removing an abandoned/old property from an area, which makes the area "nicer", thus it becomes more attractive = more demand

you're also probably will be renting more than the area average (it's a new construction now)

imagine doing this in an almost central part of a high demand city

so renting a building can actually bring prices in the area up instead of down

still - more building is better!! it does put downwards pressure on the real estate prices - but you're looking in the wrong place. you should be looking at credit instead. i wrote an article to get you started here: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html</a></p>

        <p>people are calling Christine Lagarde ignorant on Bitcoin, but don't explain how

how exactly are her statements on Bitcoin ignorant? it's not nice to insult someone, and it certainly doesn't explain how Bitcoin has the same amount and class of intrinsic value as gold - a commodity that has been money for over 5K years

what is even the purpose of a central bank holding BTC in their balance sheet today? speculative investments are not a part of their mandates and moving in that direction would be contradictory to their legally established goals

commercial banking is not the same as central banking</p>

        <p>decentralized digital Euro will not work, because the ECB needs to have full control over it

retail CBDCs are direct central bank liabilities on the balance sheet. so "neutral market infrastructure" would not work, because the ECB needs to have full control over it. you can also imagine how many regulations need to be accounted for by the implementation

it most likely won't use a public blockchain for base implementation, and it's definitely not like stablecoins üòÑ 

digital euro also needs to support offline payments, which isn't currently widely supported in DeFi. Zero Knowledge Proofs enable some potential solutions for this, but I don't believe that that's with what the ECB is going with now</p>

        <p>we are approaching a local top for silver and gold according to my market vibe meter

usually i'd write a longer post with an explanation & technicals, but today i'm writing of off vibes üòÑ

my twitter/x feed has been filled with so much euphoria regarding silver & gold that it starts to resemble those accounts which constantly promote Bitcoin

you also have to contextualize how extended gold and silver's moves have been. the graph shows monthly candles

this isn't a bearish post on gold though - still expecting $4000/oz in November 2025 üòÑ</p>

        <p>no, "The West" is not manipulating gold and silver prices

silver and gold had retracements many times before, but I guess when it falls on Chinese holidays it becomes "western manipulation"?

‚âà32% of global gold demand in 2025 comes from China (estimate for jewelry + bar & coin). China is a major buyer of gold - so a lot of demand there

a more reasonable explanation is a demand dip, due to the holiday in PRC. also the US government shutdown. although I agree the idea of a magic red button saying DUMP GOLD located somewhere in the west is more exciting üòÑ

it's also not clear what would be the purpose of manipulating the price of gold down, as that would be benefiting China - they can buy it cheaper!

PBoC has been buying gold for years, and they will continue to do so. PBoC doesn't announce targets publicly - and they're flexible on their purchases, so again, lowering the gold price would likely allow them to buy it at a cheaper price</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is not a good collateral for a loan, here's why:

1Ô∏è‚É£ You can only get ‚âà50% LVT credit
2Ô∏è‚É£ You pay higher interest than on mortgages/real estate-backed loans
3Ô∏è‚É£ You get liquidated from ‚âà80% LVT

So if your strategy is to purchase assets and use them as collateral for loans, you may be better off with real estate:

1Ô∏è‚É£ You can get more than 75% LTV credit
2Ô∏è‚É£ You'll pay lower interest for a mortgage/real estate-collateralized loan than for a BTC collateralized loan
3Ô∏è‚É£ No liquidations when real estate is collateral. If property (collateral value) falls, you may be requested a cure, but forced sales must go though courts.</p>

        <p>the majority of real estate purchases in Portugal are done with credit. moreover, each property itself can be used  as a collateral to get more credit - at least 75% of the property's value. so not only you can purchase the property, earn a yield via rents, but also get a credit/loan for 75% of value of the property

in Portugal, ‚âà90% of all credit/loans against real estate, go into investing into more real estate. so each collateraized property, can contribute ‚âà2x of its value as buying pressure for the real estate market as a whole (1x when the property is first purchased, and 0.75x-1x when the property is used as collateral to get a loan against it)

so effectively real estate itself is driving real estate prices up. banks happily finance real estate acquisitions, and lend against real estate collateral. then, most of that credit goes into purchasing more real estate, thus pushing the prices up

so the main drivers behind increasing real estate prices in Portugal are:

the real estate itself, i.e. the property itself
funding rate/cost of credit (highly influenced by ECB policy rates)
low relative transaction volume/market cap, making it easier to move the median

the first two points are generally universal across the globe. i've previously written an article about what makes real estate such a special asset from the point of view of financing. you can read it here: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html</a>

the relatively low total transactional volume, which has increased almost x3 in the past decade - makes it "easier" for buying pressure to push the housing prices up

of course, other factors contribute as well. Portugal is highly demanded area for cultural and geographical reasons - i.e. locals are welcoming and Portugal has a huge coastal area. there is also high inflation, regulatory challenges and supply chain limitations

the bottom line is that real estate purchase and rent prices in Portugal will continue to increase over medium-long term</p>

            <p>portugal golden visa real estate investments are less than 3% of total housing transactions

portuguese real estate market volume is ‚âà30B‚Ç¨/year, golden visa purchases accounted for ‚âà556M‚Ç¨/year

3% of total volume of the housing market is unlikely to be the primary driver of the national median prices increase

so next time someone tells you that one of the main drivers behind increasing Portuguese real estate prices are golden visa investments - their argument is likely to lack substance</p>

        <p>if you buy a car with Bitcoin, you're still subject to capital gains tax

under the US law cryptocurrencies are property - so you're taxed on the USD value of the car at the time of purchase minus the cost of your original crypto purchase (so you're only taxed on the gain/profit)

so if the processing fee of a payment with Ethereum is larger than it would be by selling Ethereum for USD first (e.g. transfer ETH to an exchange --> sell --> transfer to your bank account), then you end up paying more with Ethereum than you would with USD. it make sense, because you'd be removing an intermediary (i.e. you sell ETH for USD yourself)

in either case, the seller receives USD for the car, not ETH or BTC. the intermediary most likely doesn't keep ETH/BTC on their balance sheet either, they just proxy your order to the market and charge a spread</p>

        <p>central banks have rejected holding Bitcoin in their reserves including Fed, ECB, PBoC and many others

what would even be the purpose of a central bank holding BTC on their balance sheet? so that they can stabilize the value of the currency against Bitcoin? what would be the practical benefit from it now?

cross-border crypto trade in non-stablecoins is negligible. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which would make central-bank issued currency more volatile - this goes exactly against the direct mandate of most central banks - price stability.

a more volatile currency will also lead to a more volatile bond market, which will make government funding more volatile, and thus a high risk/uncertain economy

and i'm not even going to touch on the security risks. okay, maybe briefly üòÑ:

‚ûñ governments are one of the only entities that can realistically perform a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin. well, with central banks owning BTC will make such attacks much more attractive - including at the geopolitical level. the same goes for denial of service family of attacks

‚ûñ what if the central bank's wallets get hacked/compromised? i'm not talking about quantum computers breaking RSA, but operational level mistake or compromise

so for the next 10 years, I view central banks holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet as a negative sign for their currency. of course, the protocol and the bitcoin network will evolve/change over time, and with so may my stance

i believe cryptocurrencies, and more specifically distributed layer technologies/blockchain architectures can bring immense value to our financial system as a whole, but that doesn't mean that we should have central banks speculating on that today. it makes much more sense to increase gold reserves instead</p>

        <p>virtually every corporation that accepts Ethereum/Bitcoin for payments doesn't actually process the payment in crypto

they immediately covert it to USD or another FIAT, and not actually hold the BTC, ETH, etc

the convertion is generally done via an intermediary, so the company you're buying never even touch or care about the crypto asset. they want the same government-backed currencies that we use now

the intermediary will also generally charge a fee, around ‚âà1% of the transaction value. so buying directly with crypto is likely to be more expensive than directly with FIAT. if you just sell the crypto for FIAT and pay directly in USD, EUR, etc it will likely be cheaper. so what's the point of paying more?

don't be fooled by headlines or articles that suggest otherwise</p>

        <p>portugal golden visa real estate investments are less than 3% of total housing transactions

portuguese real estate market volume is ‚âà30B‚Ç¨/year, golden visa purchases accounted for ‚âà556M‚Ç¨/year

3% of total volume of the housing market is unlikely to be the primary driver of the national median prices increase

so next time someone tells you that one of the main drivers behind increasing Portuguese real estate prices are golden visa investments - their argument is likely to lack substance</p>

        <p>How Banks Create Money When Purchasing Assets

I have previously written about the unique legal powers given to commercial banks and credit institutions in general, that allow them to create new currency, thus increasing its supply. For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank‚Äôs counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled "when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money": 
<a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html</a> 

I received a question about it via e-mail, so I‚Äôm writing a follow-up with clarifications.

The flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let‚Äôs assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let‚Äôs forget about US government bonds for now, let‚Äôs say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ‚âà$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let‚Äôs also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)

Let‚Äôs say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn‚Äôt exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else‚Äôs account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created ‚Äúout of thin air‚Äù, and that money was credited into your account. I say ‚Äúcredited‚Äù because it‚Äôs from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.

Now, I referred to ‚Äúmoney in circulation‚Äù, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf</a> . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn‚Äôt touch the broader economy directly.

If instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.

In the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of ‚Äúnew money‚Äù - the money moves within the central bank‚Äôs reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank‚Äôs reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  

The following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1</a></p>
