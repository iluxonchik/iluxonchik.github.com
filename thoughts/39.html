i.e. the fund's units get traded in a permissioned manner\n\nthese are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets\n\npermissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/no-permissioned-assets-running-on-blockchains-are-not-sheep.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/no-permissioned-assets-running-on-blockchains-are-not-sheep.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-10T01:15:55+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-10T01:15:55+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b229748e-f941-5dee-b9b0-402a9aadf531.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "≈less than 50% of total land is buildable", "articleBody": "≈less than 50% of total land is buildable\n\nthis is if you want to be accurate for the near-long future\n\ndon't expect massive building in mountains, glaciers and deserts 😄", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/less-than-50-of-total-land-is-buildable.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/less-than-50-of-total-land-is-buildable.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-08T20:58:53+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-08T20:58:53+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/47841d5f-3258-553c-83ab-df9d8cbacb4f.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "neither supply nor demand are static", "articleBody": "neither supply nor demand are static\n\nif you renew a building in a high demand area you're removing an abandoned/old property from an area, which makes the area \"nicer\", thus it becomes more attractive = more demand\n\nyou're also probably will be renting more than the area average (it's a new construction now)\n\nimagine doing this in an almost central part of a high demand city\n\nso renting a building can actually bring prices in the area up instead of down\n\nstill -

For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank’s counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled \"when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money\": \nhttps://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html \n\nI received a question about it via e-mail, so I’m writing a follow-up with clarifications.\n\nThe flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let’s assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let’s forget about US government bonds for now, let’s say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ≈$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let’s also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)\n\nLet’s say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn’t exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else’s account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created “out of thin air”, and that money was credited into your account. I say “credited” because it’s from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.\n\nNow, I referred to “money in circulation”, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn’t touch the broader economy directly.\n\nIf instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.\n\nIn the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of “new money” - the money moves within the central bank’s reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank’s reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  \n\nThe following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-banks-create-money-when-purchasing-assets.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-banks-create-money-when-purchasing-assets.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-26T19:41:54+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-26T19:41:54+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/1d71ac4e-52bc-52f2-a5e0-4223f54477db.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "you can read the full article/thread explaining why September is generally a bad month for Bitcoin and other…", "articleBody": "you can read the full article/thread explaining why September is generally a bad month for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies here: https://illya.sh/threads/@1755867104-1.html", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/you-can-read-the-full-article-thread-explaining-why.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/you-can-read-the-full-article-thread-explaining-why.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T19:20:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T19:20:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/79345246-1233-50fe-9e6d-1e921abfef95.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "my article on repo rates and BTC price was referenced on bitcoin.com", "articleBody": "my article on repo rates and BTC price was referenced on bitcoin.com\n\napparently it's been there for a month, but i only noticed now\n\nit's a short read - and explains the negative price pressure that quarter-ends, and  especially September bring on the price of liquidity sensitive assets like Bitcoin\n\nit give you a concrete perspective on the current cryptocurrency price dump, even with decreasing funding rates", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/my-article-on-repo-rates-and-btc-price-was-referenced-on.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/my-article-on-repo-rates-and-btc-price-was-referenced-on.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T19:12:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T19:12:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/a61dd4da-545a-5074-86fb-eb0cef0931f5.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "even if silver goes down to $30/oz it will still be in an uptrend 🤯", "articleBody": "even if silver goes down to $30/oz it will still be in an uptrend 🤯\n\n(weekly chart)", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/even-if-silver-goes-down-to-30-oz-it-will-still-be-in-an.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/even-if-silver-goes-down-to-30-oz-it-will-still-be-in-an.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T11:41:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T11:41:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/cc570728-8faf-5e4b-912e-4ad76847b414.jpg"}]}

        <p>FYI you can ask the bank to lend you ≈75%LTV of the future property before restoration works start<br><br>so assuming you have a real estate project for restoration - the bank estimates the future value (after the immovable property is restored) and lends ≈75% of that expected future value. if you lease the property instead of buying - banks can generally finance 100%<br><br>in restoration projects the bank may also agree for a lower installment payment schedule while the works are ongoing/the property business is being setup - e.g. for the first two years of the loan you&#x27;re only paying interest installment portion without amortizing the outstanding principal amount<br><br>otherwise you&#x27;ll need another way to finance the restoration costs, and I doubt the contracting company will agree to only receive payment once your loan gets approved</p>

        <p>no, permissioned assets running on blockchains are NOT sheep in wolves&#x27; clothing<br><br>blockchains need to integrate with our existing legal systems - and the permissioned aspect is often required by law<br><br>i&#x27;m currently looking into implementing a real estate European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) on-chain with smart contracts<br><br>the EU regulations governing such funds explicitly require a permissioned control. for example, an ELTIF must be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), as per Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD). so there must always be an AIFM behind the token/smart contacts. it can&#x27;t just be &quot;ownerless&quot; decentralized contracts. by design that someone also bears legal responsibility<br><br>you&#x27;re also legally not allowed to allow retail investments into the fund without KYC, which is also a permissioned component<br><br>in order to be able to have the unit&#x27;s funds tradable on-chain without qualifying as a trading venue under MiFID II (so you don&#x27;t need additional licenses), you may want to use ELTIF RTS, which under certain conditions exempt your ELTIF smart contracts from being classified as a multilateral system. to qualify for this exception, the law requires the manager to operate windows, decide on execution prices, etc - i.e. the fund&#x27;s units get traded in a permissioned manner<br><br>these are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets<br><br>permissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure</p>

China is a major buyer of gold - so a lot of demand there<br><br>a more reasonable explanation is a demand dip, due to the holiday in PRC. also the US government shutdown. although I agree the idea of a magic red button saying DUMP GOLD located somewhere in the west is more exciting 😄<br><br>it&#x27;s also not clear what would be the purpose of manipulating the price of gold down, as that would be benefiting China - they can buy it cheaper!<br><br>PBoC has been buying gold for years, and they will continue to do so.

        <p>Bitcoin is not a good collateral for a loan, here&#x27;s why:<br><br>1️⃣ You can only get ≈50% LVT credit<br>2️⃣ You pay higher interest than on mortgages/real estate-backed loans<br>3️⃣ You get liquidated from ≈80% LVT<br><br>So if your strategy is to purchase assets and use them as collateral for loans, you may be better off with real estate:<br><br>1️⃣ You can get more than 75% LTV credit<br>2️⃣ You&#x27;ll pay lower interest for a mortgage/real estate-collateralized loan than for a BTC collateralized loan<br>3️⃣ No liquidations when real estate is collateral.

        <p>the majority of real estate purchases in Portugal are done with credit. moreover, each property itself can be used  as a collateral to get more credit - at least 75% of the property&#x27;s value. so not only you can purchase the property, earn a yield via rents, but also get a credit/loan for 75% of value of the property<br><br>in Portugal, ≈90% of all credit/loans against real estate, go into investing into more real estate. so each collateraized property, can contribute ≈2x of its value as buying pressure for the real estate market as a whole (1x when the property is first purchased, and 0.75x-1x when the property is used as collateral to get a loan against it)<br><br>so effectively real estate itself is driving real estate prices up. banks happily finance real estate acquisitions, and lend against real estate collateral. then, most of that credit goes into purchasing more real estate, thus pushing the prices up<br><br>so the main drivers behind increasing real estate prices in Portugal are:<br><br>the real estate itself, i.e. the property itself<br>funding rate/cost of credit (highly influenced by ECB policy rates)<br>low relative transaction volume/market cap, making it easier to move the median<br><br>the first two points are generally universal across the globe. i&#x27;ve previously written an article about what makes real estate such a special asset from the point of view of financing. you can read it here: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1757632740-1.html</a><br><br>the relatively low total transactional volume, which has increased almost x3 in the past decade - makes it &quot;easier&quot; for buying pressure to push the housing prices up<br><br>of course, other factors contribute as well. Portugal is highly demanded area for cultural and geographical reasons - i.e. locals are welcoming and Portugal has a huge coastal area. there is also high inflation, regulatory challenges and supply chain limitations<br><br>the bottom line is that real estate purchase and rent prices in Portugal will continue to increase over medium-long term</p>

Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which would make central-bank issued currency more volatile - this goes exactly against the direct mandate of most central banks - price stability.<br><br>a more volatile currency will also lead to a more volatile bond market, which will make government funding more volatile, and thus a high risk/uncertain economy<br><br>and i&#x27;m not even going to touch on the security risks. okay, maybe briefly 😄:<br><br>➖ governments are one of the only entities that can realistically perform a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin. well, with central banks owning BTC will make such attacks much more attractive - including at the geopolitical level. the same goes for denial of service family of attacks<br><br>➖ what if the central bank&#x27;s wallets get hacked/compromised? i&#x27;m not talking about quantum computers breaking RSA, but operational level mistake or compromise<br><br>so for the next 10 years, I view central banks holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet as a negative sign for their currency. of course, the protocol and the bitcoin network will evolve/change over time, and with so may my stance<br><br>i believe cryptocurrencies, and more specifically distributed layer technologies/blockchain architectures can bring immense value to our financial system as a whole, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should have central banks speculating on that today. it makes much more sense to increase gold reserves instead</p>

        <p>How Banks Create Money When Purchasing Assets<br><br>I have previously written about the unique legal powers given to commercial banks and credit institutions in general, that allow them to create new currency, thus increasing its supply. For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank’s counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled &quot;when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money&quot;: <br><a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html</a> <br><br>I received a question about it via e-mail, so I’m writing a follow-up with clarifications.<br><br>The flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let’s assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let’s forget about US government bonds for now, let’s say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ≈$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let’s also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)<br><br>Let’s say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn’t exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else’s account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created “out of thin air”, and that money was credited into your account. I say “credited” because it’s from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.<br><br>Now, I referred to “money in circulation”, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf</a> . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn’t touch the broader economy directly.<br><br>If instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.<br><br>In the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of “new money” - the money moves within the central bank’s reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank’s reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  <br><br>The following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1</a></p>
