        <p>Bad news for #USD 👎

The value of a currency is a direct reflection of the organic demand for it. Sanctions will decrease the demand for US Dollar, via disincentives 

Plus, it’s the US consumer that will be paying for the tariffs, not the BRICS countries 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>Very interesting alternative USD market

Usual flow:
🇺🇸 buys oil from 🇸🇦, 🇸🇦 reinvest excess back into UST

New flow:
🇸🇦 reinvests excess into 🇨🇳-issued USD bonds

Result:
USD flows to 🇨🇳, instead of 🇺🇸, as the USD-denominated debt (bonds) are issued directly by 🇨🇳</p>

        <p>📚 Learning how derivatives are priced will make you realize that all the models are based on financing with an interest rate (IR). Future value of a derivative is discounted with an IR.

Where does this extra money come from?

you may see it manifest as #inflation 😉</p>
