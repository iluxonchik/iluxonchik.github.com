        <p>China Is Hoarding Commodities<br><br>While the U.S. is pumping a crypto &amp; AI bubble, China is pumping their commodity reserves.<br><br>Not only PRC is limiting silver exports, but they&#x27;re also lowering the cost of commodity-related imports.<br><br>The net result will be more positive  commodity import/export ratio, i.e. more physical commodities within China, which will be used for strategic and industrial needs (China is the world&#x27;s number one producer).<br><br>It also means that there will be less commodities available outside of PRC, and since the global demand won&#x27;t decrease - that&#x27;s further positive price pressure on the commodity sector.<br><br>I have been writing about gold, silver and other commodities for over 2 years. The same bullish narrative remains valid. These geopolitical developments provide further confirmation.</p>
