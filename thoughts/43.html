Pattern matching based prediction is very powerful, but you need enough patterns to learn from, alongside the correct context.\n\nAdditionally, vibe-coding a large codebase is one thing, while maintaining that same codebase is another.\n\nAutopilot in commercial airplanes didn't deprecate carbon-based human pilots, but it did deprecate pilots who didn't commit to learning and integrating autopilot during the flight.\n\nSo is programming really dead, or has it merely evolved? 🤔", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/llms-ai-agents-didnt-replace-programming-they-evolved-it.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/llms-ai-agents-didnt-replace-programming-they-evolved-it.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-02T15:09:45+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-02T15:09:45+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk", "url": "https://illya.sh/"}}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Bulgarian Lev has been pegged to Euro since 1999", "articleBody": "Bulgarian Lev has been pegged to Euro since 1999\n\nBulgarian National Bank (BNB) has been operating under a currency board arrangement (CBA) regime since 1997.

In other words, if Bulgaria's Central Bank wanted to increase the base money supply of their national currency (i.e. monetary liabilities on BNB's balance sheet), they needed to foreign reserve assets backing them up at a fixed rate of 1 EUR ≈ 1.96 BGN. In practice, ≈90% of BNB's reserves were Euro-denominated, which makes sense, since BGN is pegged to the Euro.\n\nFor those claiming that by adopting the Euro as its official currency on January 1st 2026 Bulgaria has given up its monetary sovereignty - how exactly?

        <p>Misinformation About Venezuela&#x27;s Gold Reserves Is Spreading 🇻🇪<br><br>It appears that once a large finance account on X posts misinformation about Venezuela&#x27;s gold reserves, many other large-following X accounts repost it without even bothering to verify the information.<br><br>Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) doesn&#x27;t have anywhere close to 161 tonnes of gold - those are numbers from 2017. BCV&#x27;s balance sheet report, alongside the auxiliary notes released with it (specifically Note 7) from June 30th 2025 point at ≈53 tonnes of gold, which is less than a third of the claimed 161 tonnes of gold figure. I know this for a fact, because I checked that balance sheet statement myself.<br><br>On my feed, the incorrect 161 tonnes figure  started with @KobeissiLetter  post earlier today, from there, it continues to spread throughout numerous accounts, many of which have followings in the millions.<br><br>My goal is not to criticize or attack the accounts spreading this incorrect information, but to incentivize checking the information yourself before reposting/spreading it.<br><br>In a follow-up post I&#x27;ll do a more detailed breakdown of BCV&#x27;s balance sheet, especially in terms of gold, so stay tuned.</p>

        <p>Ruble was the best performing major currency of 2025, and it&#x27;s easy to understand why<br><br>What Russia did is replace USD-denominated securities (treasuries, bonds, etc) with gold.<br><br>Gold is almost 40% of Russia&#x27;s Central bank balance sheet, compare it to ≈20% for European Union, ≈16% for U.S. and ≈5% for China. This leaves Russia&#x27;s central bank with a massive balance sheet capacity for the future and supports the Ruble price.<br><br>There&#x27;s also the National Wealth Fund, which commits to buying gold when Urals oil is sold/traded above a certain price.</p>

        <p>The big play on precious metals mining stocks is that production costs remain (much) smaller than the metal&#x27;s spot price<br><br>For gold - the cost to produce/mine 1 oz is roughly $2000. Then, those same miners sell it for more than $4000. Instant &gt;$2000 profit per ounce (again, rough numbers) 😄<br><br>So from the current levels, assuming production costs increase less than the spot price of the metal - miners win big. I believe this will be the case.<br><br>I wrote a more detailed article explains gold mining costs and miner profits here: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/1-oz-of-gold-production-cost-and-miner-profit" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/1-oz-of-gold-production-cost-and-miner-profit</a></p>

        <p>LLMs &amp; AI Agents Didn&#x27;t Replace Programming - They Evolved It<br><br>I&#x27;ve been programming with LLMs since 2022, implementing systems of varied complexity, both professionally and exploratory/hobby projects. And I will continue to do so in 2026. However, it&#x27;s important to be aware of its limits.<br><br>Vibe/agent coding for critical systems doesn&#x27;t work well (yet).<br><br>You&#x27;ll also be disappointed if you&#x27;re trying to do something with financial markets (e.g. Machine-Learning based models).<br><br>Vibe coded apps also frequently come with security vulnerabilities (for many apps this may be an acceptable compromise).<br><br>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be comfortable with driving a vehicle with all of its software vibe-coded, or with all code written by an agentic system, without thorough human investment.<br><br>LLMs are good at solving problems that have been solved many time before, but this abstraction quickly breaks apart if you delve with them into less developed topics, which frequent tend to be more complex. Pattern matching based prediction is very powerful, but you need enough patterns to learn from, alongside the correct context.<br><br>Additionally, vibe-coding a large codebase is one thing, while maintaining that same codebase is another.<br><br>Autopilot in commercial airplanes didn&#x27;t deprecate carbon-based human pilots, but it did deprecate pilots who didn&#x27;t commit to learning and integrating autopilot during the flight.<br><br>So is programming really dead, or has it merely evolved? 🤔</p>

        <p>Bulgarian Lev has been pegged to Euro since 1999<br><br>Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) has been operating under a currency board arrangement (CBA) regime since 1997. First, it was pegged to the Deutsche Mark, then to the Euro. They also redenominated their currency from Old Bulgarian Lev (BGL) to New Bulgarian Lev (BGN).<br><br>Under CBA, BNB&#x27;s monetary liabilities must be fully covered by foreign reserves. In other words, if Bulgaria&#x27;s Central Bank wanted to increase the base money supply of their national currency (i.e. monetary liabilities on BNB&#x27;s balance sheet), they needed to foreign reserve assets backing them up at a fixed rate of 1 EUR ≈ 1.96 BGN. In practice, ≈90% of BNB&#x27;s reserves were Euro-denominated, which makes sense, since BGN is pegged to the Euro.<br><br>For those claiming that by adopting the Euro as its official currency on January 1st 2026 Bulgaria has given up its monetary sovereignty - how exactly? BNB has been extremely limited in pursuing discretionary monetary policies since 1997.</p>

        <p>Gold hasn&#x27;t even touched its daily level uptrend support and finance accounts on X are already calling for a top<br><br>I have been writing my price thesis on gold for 2 years now, and since my call in December 2023 gold&#x27;s price is up ≈125%. In the last day or 2025 my call is that this uptrend will continue.<br><br>Regarding local tops, it&#x27;s worth noting that gold has been in one for over 2 months now.<br><br>Additionally, closes below a seemingly arbitrary 4H support line drawn on a chart does not imply any significant top or trend reversal. Gold can go down to $3900 and still be in an uptrend!<br><br>TA &amp; charting is supportive, as it gives you hints about what the market is doing, but on its own it can&#x27;t provide you with a high-confidence prediction of the future. <br><br>If you lack the foundation on the basis of the price action of an asset, you&#x27;ll find it much more challenging to distinguish a dip from a longer-term trend reversal. I&#x27;ve written several articles explaining why gold&#x27;s price will keep going up, in terms of currency debasement, refinancing cycles, global liquidity and geopolitical pressures. You can access those threads/articles on my website free or cost. They&#x27;ll provide you with a solid basis for understanding gold, where its price headed and why.</p>
