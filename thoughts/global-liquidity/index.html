For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank’s counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled \"when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money\": \nhttps://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html \n\nI received a question about it via e-mail, so I’m writing a follow-up with clarifications.\n\nThe flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let’s assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let’s forget about US government bonds for now, let’s say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ≈$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let’s also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)\n\nLet’s say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn’t exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else’s account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created “out of thin air”, and that money was credited into your account. I say “credited” because it’s from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.\n\nNow, I referred to “money in circulation”, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn’t touch the broader economy directly.\n\nIf instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.\n\nIn the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of “new money” - the money moves within the central bank’s reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank’s reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  \n\nThe following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-banks-create-money-when-purchasing-assets.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-banks-create-money-when-purchasing-assets.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-26T19:41:54+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-26T19:41:54+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/1d71ac4e-52bc-52f2-a5e0-4223f54477db.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "my article on repo rates and BTC price was referenced on bitcoin.com", "articleBody": "my article on repo rates and BTC price was referenced on bitcoin.com\n\napparently it's been there for a month, but i only noticed now\n\nit's a short read - and explains the negative price pressure that quarter-ends, and  especially September bring on the price of liquidity sensitive assets like Bitcoin\n\nit give you a concrete perspective on the current cryptocurrency price dump, even with decreasing funding rates", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/my-article-on-repo-rates-and-btc-price-was-referenced-on.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/my-article-on-repo-rates-and-btc-price-was-referenced-on.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-25T19:12:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-25T19:12:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/a61dd4da-545a-5074-86fb-eb0cef0931f5.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "lower interest rates means less attractive repo and deposit rates, thus expect more capital movement into ass...", "articleBody": "lower interest rates means less attractive repo and deposit rates, thus expect more capital movement into assets, as the yields on MMF/deposits become less attractive\n\noverall positive pressure on asset prices\n\nfor the next 3 years - gold, silver  and real estate (real estate is more region specific) are great assets to hold\n\ni'd be wary of US equities\n\nwhile it's not the top yet and they'll still move higher - you need to be on the lookout the cycle top, which will manifest in some form in the medium long-term\n\nin the next two years it's reasonable to expect a significant downturn in US equities, which may or may not be longer-lasting. it largely depends on the specific QE & other government policies taken to modulate liquidity and yields\n\nso if you're heavily exposed to US equities, it's a good idea to monitor it closely, as there's a risk of a significant downturn\n\nthe biggest downside risk to US equities comes from FX, namely from the value and dominance of the US dollar:\n\n➖ while a weaker USD is positive for cross-border USD credit/liquidity, it also makes imports more expensive for the US - and US is a net importer. increased import prices will put negative pressure on the whole economy, including publicly-traded companies\n\n➖ less dominance/demand of USD will not only lead to less total USD abroad available to invest into the US equities, but also lead to the further development of non-USD financial markets because the capital that moves away from USD will need to get invested somewhere. China is the most obvious candidate to benefit from these developments, especially when it comes to equities and renminbi demand. i believe the EU is in a unique position to attract a lot of that USD-exiling demand, but that would require opening-up the markets and regulatory adaptations in that direction", "url":

        <p>Primary Dealers Failures To Settle Implications For Risk Assets<br><br>Security settlement failures on the dealer side are a signal of liquidity stress. In short, it signals that either collateral (securities) or USD liquidity are short. Generally, this is bearish for risk assets.<br><br>Dealers exercise a key liquidity role in the financial markets microstructure, so a significant stress on their operations will propagate throughout the market.<br><br>You can anecdotally visualize this correlation in Bitcoin by noticing that the peaks of failures to receive/deliver by dealers coincide with at least short-term tops for Bitcoin prices.<br><br>This weekly set of data is made freely available by Office of Financial Research (OFR), and you can download it CSV or JSON formats.

        <p>How Banks Create Money When Purchasing Assets<br><br>I have previously written about the unique legal powers given to commercial banks and credit institutions in general, that allow them to create new currency, thus increasing its supply. For banks, this also extends to their open market operations, such as when they buy securities and other assets from the open market. If the bank’s counterparty happens to be a non-bank, or more generally an entity without an account at the central bank, then the bank will create new currency to pay for that transaction. I described this in my thread/article titled &quot;when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank it creates broad money&quot;: <br><a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1755863018-1.html</a> <br><br>I received a question about it via e-mail, so I’m writing a follow-up with clarifications.<br><br>The flow that I was describing the thread linked above is what happens when a bank buys an asset from a non-bank. Let’s assume the bank ABC wants to buy an asset from you. Let’s forget about US government bonds for now, let’s say the bank wants to buy 100 shares of Tesla from you. The current market price for 1 Tesla share is ≈$450, so the ABC bank would pay you $45000 and you will give the bank the 100 shares. Let’s also assume you have an account in that bank (this is not mandatory!)<br><br>Let’s say that right before the bank makes a purchase from you (a microsecond before that transaction/sale happens) there is a total of $1 million ($1000000) of US dollars in circulation. The moment right after the transaction is made, and the bank crediting your account with $45000, the total money in circulation would become $1 000 000 +  $45000 = $1 045 000. The main point here is that those  $45000 didn’t exist in circulation before. They were not taken from someone else’s account, nor from internal bank reserves. Those  $45000 were created “out of thin air”, and that money was credited into your account. I say “credited” because it’s from the point of view of the bank - your deposit account at the bank is a liability to the bank - it sits on the liabilities side of the balance sheet - a credit increases liabilities.<br><br>Now, I referred to “money in circulation”, but I actually meant Broad Money. There is another form of money - called Broad Money. There is a great paper from the Bank of England that describes them, alongside how commercial banks create money: <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf</a> . But in short, Broad Money is the money available for use by the larger economy (individuals, companies, etc), while Base Money is physical currency and currency held in reserve accounts at  the central bank - the reserve accounts portion doesn’t touch the broader economy directly.<br><br>If instead a bank ABC purchases an asset from another bank DEF - then the total money does not change. The bank ABC would just debit their reserve account at the central bank and credit the reserve account of the bank DEF. So money moves accounts, but total quantity does not change.<br><br>In the same manner, when a commercial bank buys bonds directly from the government, there is no creation of “new money” - the money moves within the central bank’s reserve accounts. The general rule is: if the transacting entities have reserve accounts in the central bank the transaction is made within the central bank’s reserve accounts.  Commercial banks, governments and sometimes select financial institutions (like in the US) have reserve accounts at the central bank, so transactions within them move Base Money  <br><br>The following article on how commercial banks work will be very helpful to understand how they operate and create money: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/@1754426330-1</a></p>
