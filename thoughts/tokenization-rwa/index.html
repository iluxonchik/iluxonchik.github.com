While there have been some ELTIF tokenization initiatives by some funds in the EU - they all used non-public (e.g. in-house) distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions, with scarce public information on the implementation details.\n\nThe idea of fully on-chain ELTIF is attractive for several reasons:\n\n➖ It taps into trillions of USD of readily available on-chain liquidity\n➖ It reduces processing, compliance, distribution and infrastructure costs\n➖It's fully compliant with the existing EU legislation\n\nIn terms of DeFi, bridging the real world financial system on-chain enables investment vehicles, which are fully compliant with the legal systems in the EU, and by extension most jurisdictions. This increases the value of the whole DeFi ecosystem, by making it more attractive for institutional and retail investment.\n\nTo date, there isn't a clear and practical framework for operating an ELTIF fund on a public, permissionless DLT. Such a framework must encapsulate not only the legal aspects (those already exist - the relevant regulations themselves!), but also the technical details of operating the ELTIF fund via smart contracts, while remaining fully compliant with the EU legislation. This is the gap that I’m aiming to address.\n\nI’ll be focusing on real-estate based ELTIFs - where the fund pools money from investors, invests it into real estate and collects yield from rents and appreciation, as it goes inline with my current area of work.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/tokenizing-european-long-term-investment-funds-eltif-2-0-on", "mainEntityOfPage":

legal systems - and the permissioned aspect is often required by law\n\ni'm currently looking into implementing a real estate European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) on-chain with smart contracts\n\nthe EU regulations governing such funds explicitly require a permissioned control. for example, an ELTIF must be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), as per Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD). so there must always be an AIFM behind the token/smart contacts. it can't just be \"ownerless\" decentralized contracts. by design that someone also bears legal responsibility\n\nyou're also legally not allowed to allow retail investments into the fund without KYC, which is also a permissioned component\n\nin order to be able to have the unit's funds tradable on-chain without qualifying as a trading venue under MiFID II (so you don't need additional licenses), you may want to use ELTIF RTS, which under certain conditions exempt your ELTIF smart contracts from being classified as a multilateral system. to qualify for this exception, the law requires the manager to operate windows, decide on execution prices, etc - i.e. the fund's units get traded in a permissioned manner\n\nthese are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets\n\npermissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure", "url":

        <p>Tokenizing European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) on a Public Blockchain<br><br>Currently I&#x27;m working on a practical framework for tokenizing European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) instruments on a smart contract-enabled public blockchain like Ethereum. While there have been some ELTIF tokenization initiatives by some funds in the EU - they all used non-public (e.g. in-house) distributed ledger technology (DLT) solutions, with scarce public information on the implementation details.<br><br>The idea of fully on-chain ELTIF is attractive for several reasons:<br><br>➖ It taps into trillions of USD of readily available on-chain liquidity<br>➖ It reduces processing, compliance, distribution and infrastructure costs<br>➖It&#x27;s fully compliant with the existing EU legislation<br><br>In terms of DeFi, bridging the real world financial system on-chain enables investment vehicles, which are fully compliant with the legal systems in the EU, and by extension most jurisdictions. This increases the value of the whole DeFi ecosystem, by making it more attractive for institutional and retail investment.<br><br>To date, there isn&#x27;t a clear and practical framework for operating an ELTIF fund on a public, permissionless DLT. Such a framework must encapsulate not only the legal aspects (those already exist - the relevant regulations themselves!), but also the technical details of operating the ELTIF fund via smart contracts, while remaining fully compliant with the EU legislation. This is the gap that I’m aiming to address.<br><br>I’ll be focusing on real-estate based ELTIFs - where the fund pools money from investors, invests it into real estate and collects yield from rents and appreciation, as it goes inline with my current area of work.</p>

        <p>no, permissioned assets running on blockchains are NOT sheep in wolves&#x27; clothing<br><br>blockchains need to integrate with our existing legal systems - and the permissioned aspect is often required by law<br><br>i&#x27;m currently looking into implementing a real estate European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) on-chain with smart contracts<br><br>the EU regulations governing such funds explicitly require a permissioned control. for example, an ELTIF must be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), as per Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD). so there must always be an AIFM behind the token/smart contacts. it can&#x27;t just be &quot;ownerless&quot; decentralized contracts. by design that someone also bears legal responsibility<br><br>you&#x27;re also legally not allowed to allow retail investments into the fund without KYC, which is also a permissioned component<br><br>in order to be able to have the unit&#x27;s funds tradable on-chain without qualifying as a trading venue under MiFID II (so you don&#x27;t need additional licenses), you may want to use ELTIF RTS, which under certain conditions exempt your ELTIF smart contracts from being classified as a multilateral system. to qualify for this exception, the law requires the manager to operate windows, decide on execution prices, etc - i.e. the fund&#x27;s units get traded in a permissioned manner<br><br>these are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets<br><br>permissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure</p>
