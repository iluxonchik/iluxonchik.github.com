        <p>a reminder that Russia doesn't trade with USA anymore 🇺🇸🤝🇷🇺 

so it's not clear what 100% or 9999% tariffs on Russia will achieve

Russia's been offloading US securities for gold since 2018

Russia's exports to the US are less than 1% of the total</p>

            <p>🇷🇺 Russia is immune to US tariffs 

Russia's international reserves are as follows:
- 0.007% US Treasury bonds
- 35% Gold

Russia exports <1% to the US. Russia is a net exporter

This makes them protected from US sovereign risk (USD devaluation) & trade risk</p>

            <p>Ruble is a gold success story ✨

Sanctions, tariffs, raising M2 - it doesn't care

Central Bank Of Russia sold off their US bonds & loaded up on gold

⬇️ US bond prices are down
⬆️ Gold is up
⬆️ Ruble is up against USD

Expect this playbook to be repeated by others</p>

        <p>🛢️🤭 crude oil almost back to "the market is never wrong" price

i warned about the pullback being temporary a month ago

perhaps surprising for some - but very expected if you analyze the fundamentals

the scale of the pullback was your sign number 1

more upside to come 👀</p>

            <p>Silver back to August 2020 price

After a tariffs-induced pullback of 15% today, silver is now at start of COVID prices
