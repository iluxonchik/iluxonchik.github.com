You can read more about it here: https://illya.sh/threads/tokenizing-european-long-term-investment-funds-eltif-2-0-on\n\nThis is financial markets legislation heavy topic, and it involves several regulations and directives, each one meticulously outlining rules and exceptions which together form a framework for operating various investment funds in the European Union.\n\nI come across many negative commentaries regarding EU regulations in general, but not so many explaining those regulations. In general, there is not much information covering this topic on the internet, and if you ask ChatGPT to explain it - it will likely take you several iterations and back-and-forth to understand it.\n\nSince this falls under my current area of work - I thought that it would be useful to share the knowledge, and provide a clear and concise starting point for anyone looking into investment funds legislation and practical application in the European Union.\n\nSo first of all let’s start with the definition of a “fund”. EU law doesn’t have a unanimous definition for what constitutes a fund. Instead, it defines rules for two collective investment schemes:\n\n1️⃣ Undertakings for Collective Investment In Transferable Securities (UCITS) defined in Directive 2009/65/EC\n2️⃣ Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) defined in AIFMD Directive 2011/61/EU\n\nUCITS is defined as an undertaking whose sole purpose is collective investment in transferable securities and other liquid financial assets, with the holders of UCITS units/shares being able to redeem/repurchase them on demand out of UCITS’s assets/holdings. The strict list of eligible assets is defined in Article 50 of Directive 2009/65/EC and it includes:\n\n1️⃣ Transferable securities, which are securities that are negotiable/tradable on capital markets, such as shares/equities and bonds.\n2️⃣ Money market instruments\n3️⃣ Deposits with credit institutions\n4️⃣ Certain financial derivatives\n\nAs per Article 5, a UCITS must be managed by “management company”, which is defined as a company whose regular business is to manage UCITS (Article 2(1)(b)), or set up as a self-managed investment company under Articles 29-31. As per Article 6(1) this management company must be authorized. Before a UCITS is authorized its’s management company must be authorized.\n\nAlternative Investment Fund (AIF) is defined in Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMD) to encompass all undertakings that raise capital from investors, invest according to a clearly defined investment policy for the benefit of the investors, and do not require UCITS authorization. In this sense, AIF is a functional classification, and it explicitly captures other collective investments that do not fall under the UCITS definition, as per Directive 2009/65/EC.\n\nAs a general rule, anything that’s a collective investment undertaking, but not a UCITS is an AIF. That definition comes directly from AIFMD Article 4.\n\nAn AIF must always be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM). Under Article 4(1)(b) of AIFMD, an AIFM is defined as “legal persons whose regular business is managing one or more AIFs”. Article 5 from AIFMD further reinforces this idea by requiring every AIF to have a single AIFM legally responsible for its compliance. This management entity can either be external (external AIFM) or the AIF may be managed internally with the AIF itself obtaining AIFM authorization. Article 6(1) mandates that no entity may manage an AIF, unless they are authorized as an AIFM (i.e. the managing entity must be authorized). The AIFM in an AIF is equivalent to the “management company” in UCITS.\n\nEuropean Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF), defined in  Regulation (EU) 2015/760, and later amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/606 , is a type of Alternative Investment Fund (AIF). All ELTIF are AIF, but in order for an AIF to be ELTIF, it must meet the requirements outlined in the regulation and is subject for authorization.\n\nAs such, under the EU law, ELTIF is not a distinct class of funds/collective investment schemes, but rather a legal label that an AIF can apply for. Since an ELTIF is an AIF, it is also managed by an AIFM.\n\nSo what distinguishes an ELTIF from a “regular” AIF? In short, it’s the type of assets that the collective investment undertaking holds. Among others, an ELTIF must invest ≥55% of its capital into eligible assets, which include real assets (e.g. real estate) and STS securitizations. Moreover, an ELTIF cannot invest into commodities, the use of financial derivatives is only allowed for hedging and there are limits on borrowing/leverage.\n\nSo why would one bother with the ELTIF label? Well, having the ELTIF label means your collective investment undertaking product is available to retail (i.e. to non-professional investors) EU-wide. An ELTIF allows you to offer illiquid investments to retail in the whole European Union\n\nIn conclusion -  EU law defines a fund as a collective investment undertaking, and it can be of two types: UCITS or AIF. An ELTIF is a type of AIF, which comes with retail EU passport benefits.\n\nThis article doesn’t aim to be exhaustive, but rather to be used as the basis for forming a mental model on the legal structure of funds in the European Union, and how the ELTIF fits into the framework.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/european-investment-funds-explained-ucits-aifs-aifmd-and-the.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/european-investment-funds-explained-ucits-aifs-aifmd-and-the.html", "datePublished": "2025-11-05T20:10:41+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-05T20:10:41+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/71758d39-a421-54dc-89a4-7761d6761d6a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "no, permissioned assets running on blockchains are NOT sheep in wolves' clothing", "articleBody": "no, permissioned assets running on blockchains are NOT sheep in wolves' clothing\n\nblockchains need to integrate with our existing legal systems - and the permissioned aspect is often required by law\n\ni'm currently looking into implementing a real estate European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) on-chain with smart contracts\n\nthe EU regulations governing such funds explicitly require a permissioned control. for example, an ELTIF must be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), as per Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD). so there must always be an AIFM behind the token/smart contacts. it can't just be \"ownerless\" decentralized contracts. by design that someone also bears legal responsibility\n\nyou're also legally not allowed to allow retail investments into the fund without KYC, which is also a permissioned component\n\nin order to be able to have the unit's funds tradable on-chain without qualifying as a trading venue under MiFID II (so you don't need additional licenses), you may want to use ELTIF RTS, which under certain conditions exempt your ELTIF smart contracts from being classified as a multilateral system. to qualify for this exception, the law requires the manager to operate windows, decide on execution prices, etc - i.e. the fund's units get traded in a permissioned manner\n\nthese are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets\n\npermissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/no-permissioned-assets-running-on-blockchains-are-not-sheep.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/no-permissioned-assets-running-on-blockchains-are-not-sheep.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-10T01:15:55+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-10T01:15:55+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b229748e-f941-5dee-b9b0-402a9aadf531.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "decentralized digital Euro will not work, because the ECB needs to have full control over it", "articleBody": "decentralized digital Euro will not work, because the ECB needs to have full control over it\n\nretail CBDCs are direct central bank liabilities on the balance sheet. so \"neutral market infrastructure\" would not work, because the ECB needs to have full control over it. you can also imagine how many regulations need to be accounted for by the implementation\n\nit most likely won't use a public blockchain for base implementation, and it's definitely not like stablecoins 😄 \n\ndigital euro also needs to support offline payments, which isn't currently widely supported in DeFi.

        <p>Bulgarian Lev has been pegged to Euro since 1999<br><br>Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) has been operating under a currency board arrangement (CBA) regime since 1997. First, it was pegged to the Deutsche Mark, then to the Euro. They also redenominated their currency from Old Bulgarian Lev (BGL) to New Bulgarian Lev (BGN).<br><br>Under CBA, BNB&#x27;s monetary liabilities must be fully covered by foreign reserves. In other words, if Bulgaria&#x27;s Central Bank wanted to increase the base money supply of their national currency (i.e. monetary liabilities on BNB&#x27;s balance sheet), they needed to foreign reserve assets backing them up at a fixed rate of 1 EUR ≈ 1.96 BGN. In practice, ≈90% of BNB&#x27;s reserves were Euro-denominated, which makes sense, since BGN is pegged to the Euro.<br><br>For those claiming that by adopting the Euro as its official currency on January 1st 2026 Bulgaria has given up its monetary sovereignty - how exactly? BNB has been extremely limited in pursuing discretionary monetary policies since 1997.</p>

        <p>European Investment Funds Explained: UCITS, AIFs, AIFMD and the ELTIF Regime<br><br>As I’ve previously written, I am working on a framework for tokenizing European Long Term Investment Fund operation (ELTIF 2.0) on a public, smart-contract enabled blockchain like Ethereum. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/tokenizing-european-long-term-investment-funds-eltif-2-0-on" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/tokenizing-european-long-term-investment-funds-eltif-2-0-on</a><br><br>This is financial markets legislation heavy topic, and it involves several regulations and directives, each one meticulously outlining rules and exceptions which together form a framework for operating various investment funds in the European Union.<br><br>I come across many negative commentaries regarding EU regulations in general, but not so many explaining those regulations. In general, there is not much information covering this topic on the internet, and if you ask ChatGPT to explain it - it will likely take you several iterations and back-and-forth to understand it.<br><br>Since this falls under my current area of work - I thought that it would be useful to share the knowledge, and provide a clear and concise starting point for anyone looking into investment funds legislation and practical application in the European Union.<br><br>So first of all let’s start with the definition of a “fund”. EU law doesn’t have a unanimous definition for what constitutes a fund. Instead, it defines rules for two collective investment schemes:<br><br>1️⃣ Undertakings for Collective Investment In Transferable Securities (UCITS) defined in Directive 2009/65/EC<br>2️⃣ Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) defined in AIFMD Directive 2011/61/EU<br><br>UCITS is defined as an undertaking whose sole purpose is collective investment in transferable securities and other liquid financial assets, with the holders of UCITS units/shares being able to redeem/repurchase them on demand out of UCITS’s assets/holdings. The strict list of eligible assets is defined in Article 50 of Directive 2009/65/EC and it includes:<br><br>1️⃣ Transferable securities, which are securities that are negotiable/tradable on capital markets, such as shares/equities and bonds.<br>2️⃣ Money market instruments<br>3️⃣ Deposits with credit institutions<br>4️⃣ Certain financial derivatives<br><br>As per Article 5, a UCITS must be managed by “management company”, which is defined as a company whose regular business is to manage UCITS (Article 2(1)(b)), or set up as a self-managed investment company under Articles 29-31. As per Article 6(1) this management company must be authorized. Before a UCITS is authorized its’s management company must be authorized.<br><br>Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) is defined in Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMD) to encompass all undertakings that raise capital from investors, invest according to a clearly defined investment policy for the benefit of the investors, and do not require UCITS authorization. In this sense, AIF is a functional classification, and it explicitly captures other collective investments that do not fall under the UCITS definition, as per Directive 2009/65/EC.<br><br>As a general rule, anything that’s a collective investment undertaking, but not a UCITS is an AIF. That definition comes directly from AIFMD Article 4.<br><br>An AIF must always be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM). Under Article 4(1)(b) of AIFMD, an AIFM is defined as “legal persons whose regular business is managing one or more AIFs”. Article 5 from AIFMD further reinforces this idea by requiring every AIF to have a single AIFM legally responsible for its compliance. This management entity can either be external (external AIFM) or the AIF may be managed internally with the AIF itself obtaining AIFM authorization. Article 6(1) mandates that no entity may manage an AIF, unless they are authorized as an AIFM (i.e. the managing entity must be authorized). The AIFM in an AIF is equivalent to the “management company” in UCITS.<br><br>European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF), defined in  Regulation (EU) 2015/760, and later amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/606 , is a type of Alternative Investment Fund (AIF). All ELTIF are AIF, but in order for an AIF to be ELTIF, it must meet the requirements outlined in the regulation and is subject for authorization.<br><br>As such, under the EU law, ELTIF is not a distinct class of funds/collective investment schemes, but rather a legal label that an AIF can apply for. Since an ELTIF is an AIF, it is also managed by an AIFM.<br><br>So what distinguishes an ELTIF from a “regular” AIF? In short, it’s the type of assets that the collective investment undertaking holds. Among others, an ELTIF must invest ≥55% of its capital into eligible assets, which include real assets (e.g. real estate) and STS securitizations. Moreover, an ELTIF cannot invest into commodities, the use of financial derivatives is only allowed for hedging and there are limits on borrowing/leverage.<br><br>So why would one bother with the ELTIF label? Well, having the ELTIF label means your collective investment undertaking product is available to retail (i.e. to non-professional investors) EU-wide. An ELTIF allows you to offer illiquid investments to retail in the whole European Union<br><br>In conclusion -  EU law defines a fund as a collective investment undertaking, and it can be of two types: UCITS or AIF. An ELTIF is a type of AIF, which comes with retail EU passport benefits.<br><br>This article doesn’t aim to be exhaustive, but rather to be used as the basis for forming a mental model on the legal structure of funds in the European Union, and how the ELTIF fits into the framework.</p>

        <p>no, permissioned assets running on blockchains are NOT sheep in wolves&#x27; clothing<br><br>blockchains need to integrate with our existing legal systems - and the permissioned aspect is often required by law<br><br>i&#x27;m currently looking into implementing a real estate European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) on-chain with smart contracts<br><br>the EU regulations governing such funds explicitly require a permissioned control. for example, an ELTIF must be managed by an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), as per Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD). so there must always be an AIFM behind the token/smart contacts. it can&#x27;t just be &quot;ownerless&quot; decentralized contracts. by design that someone also bears legal responsibility<br><br>you&#x27;re also legally not allowed to allow retail investments into the fund without KYC, which is also a permissioned component<br><br>in order to be able to have the unit&#x27;s funds tradable on-chain without qualifying as a trading venue under MiFID II (so you don&#x27;t need additional licenses), you may want to use ELTIF RTS, which under certain conditions exempt your ELTIF smart contracts from being classified as a multilateral system. to qualify for this exception, the law requires the manager to operate windows, decide on execution prices, etc - i.e. the fund&#x27;s units get traded in a permissioned manner<br><br>these are just some of practical examples. as you see, there are many reasons for using a permissioned design in your blockchain assets<br><br>permissionless is great, but practical value is more important. we need more solutions that work with the existing legal and financial system infrastructure</p>
