gold's starting price per gram is ≈100 days of labor! This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago\n\nSo using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today's USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it's useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold's USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.\n\nWill Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form. Gold (Au) hasn't changed in 13 billion years\n\nBitcoin promo accounts love to compare BTC to gold, and they frequently cite that BTC is up much more than gold over the last 16 years. The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent\n\nWhat the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived. As such, such comparisons fail short\n\nThey also seem to selectively omit the massive volatility - gold doesn't go down 80% every other day/cycle top\n\nThe gold prices here I computed are estimates - don't take them as hard quantitive data. Read this in the context of comparing the price of gold and Bitcoin. If someone's argument is that Bitcoin is better than gold because it had a higher percentual return in 16 years - it likely lacks substance", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/btc-went-from-0-004-to-110-000-usd-in-16-years-but-gold-was", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/btc-went-from-0-004-to-110-000-usd-in-16-years-but-gold-was", "datePublished": "2025-10-18T12:28:03+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-18T12:28:03+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/btc-went-from-0-004-to-110-000-usd-in-16-years-but-gold-was.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "no, \"The West\" is not manipulating gold and silver prices", "articleBody": "no, \"The West\" is not manipulating gold and silver prices\n\nsilver and gold had retracements many times before, but I guess when it falls on Chinese holidays it becomes \"western manipulation\"?\n\n≈32% of global gold demand in 2025 comes from China (estimate for jewelry + bar & coin).

        <p>Gold is within the fabric of money, not just Central Banks<br><br>A lot of posts on X frame Central Banks as malevolent institutions, and by some form of conspiracy they hold gold in their reserve accounts. And apparently not holding gold is a step towards monetary freedom - even more if you forego an atomic element (Au) for a cryptographic computer algorithm (Bitcoin).<br><br>A more productive approach is asking why do Central Banks chose gold over all other commodities and assets. Every single world reserve currency, without exception, started on a gold and/or silver standard. Gold has been used as money for over 5000 years.<br><br>I&#x27;ve written several articles on what makes gold so special and how Bitcoin is not a replacement for gold. I&#x27;ll leave them linked below</p>

        <p>BTC went from $0.004 to $110,000 USD in 16 years, but gold was never this cheap in over 5000 years<br><br>Going back to the start of recorded price systems - gold&#x27;s starting price per gram is ≈100 days of labor! This was in 2112 BCE, which was ≈4K years ago<br><br>So using earliest records of starting price - 1g of gold would cost ≈25K$ is today&#x27;s USD 🤯 NOTE: this is an imprecise estimation - but it&#x27;s useful to bring the gold vs bitcoin price increase argument in perspective. During most of gold&#x27;s USD history its price has been fixed by the government/law.<br><br>Will Bitcoin be here in 5K years? No - not in its current form.

The number is big - from its inception Bitcoin is up millionth of percent<br><br>What the pro-crypto accounts fail to point out is that mathematically their conclusions are misleading. They almost always use USD as the base currency for comparison, but ignore the fact that gold was used as money several millennia before U.S. was even conceived.

        <p>no, &quot;The West&quot; is not manipulating gold and silver prices<br><br>silver and gold had retracements many times before, but I guess when it falls on Chinese holidays it becomes &quot;western manipulation&quot;?<br><br>≈32% of global gold demand in 2025 comes from China (estimate for jewelry + bar &amp; coin). China is a major buyer of gold - so a lot of demand there<br><br>a more reasonable explanation is a demand dip, due to the holiday in PRC. also the US government shutdown. although I agree the idea of a magic red button saying DUMP GOLD located somewhere in the west is more exciting 😄<br><br>it&#x27;s also not clear what would be the purpose of manipulating the price of gold down, as that would be benefiting China - they can buy it cheaper!<br><br>PBoC has been buying gold for years, and they will continue to do so. PBoC doesn&#x27;t announce targets publicly - and they&#x27;re flexible on their purchases, so again, lowering the gold price would likely allow them to buy it at a cheaper price</p>

        <p>gold moves up by ≈13% on breakouts, thus ≈$4000/oz gold in November 2025<br><br>this means that the current move would bring the gold price up to ≈$3978, which should happen at the start of November, around November 4th 2025<br><br>so far, gold has completed ≈6% of the current move - which means there&#x27;s another ≈7% to move up from the current gold price of ≈$3715<br><br>this makes ≈$4000 the top of the next consolidation range. once that price is approached - expect a larger pullback, and potentially a longer consolidation phase, which could last ≈90 days. this means that after the top of the current move is hit (≈$4000) you may have to wait for another ≈3 months before a new all time high<br><br>it&#x27;s important to note that the top of the target range is close to $4000, so gold may not cross $4K before the aforementioned pullback. this means that it may take gold another 4 months before gold firmly sits over $4000/oz</p>
