So I connected to the ESP32 with a LoRA module over bluetooth, and was able to send and receive messages from a Python script running on a laptop.\n\nEssentially, the laptop uses the microcontroller as a proxy for the sub-GHz antenna (EU_868/≈868 MHz in Europe), enabling it to send and receive LoRa messages via Meshtastic's firmware. So effectively Bluetooth Low Energy is used as a proxy protocol for LoRa.\n\nThere were two nodes in the mesh - one connected to the laptop and another to a smartphone. Both nodes had the same channel name, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and ordering (channel id) setup. The laptop node was using Python to connect to the mesh via BLE and exchange messages. The smartphone was connected to the other node, and the official Meshtastic app was used to send and receive messages.\n\nThe setup is as follows:\n\n💻 Laptop (Python)\n   ⇅ BLE\n📡 Node A (ESP32 + LoRa)\n   ≈≈≈ 868 MHz LoRa mesh ≈≈≈\n📡 Node B (ESP32 + LoRa)\n   ⇅ BLE\n📱 Phone (Meshtastic app)\n\nSo you don't really need to program the ESP32 to make it a \"smart\" LoRa node. You can program all of the logic on your usual dev machine, and use BLE as a proxy for LoRa packets over Meshtastic. This is a great approach for iterative development, prototyping, proof of concepts and even final products. Of course, you can also put the smart node code on a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or even the microcontroller itself.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/laptop-as-a-meshtastic-lora-node-using-esp32-ble-and-python", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/laptop-as-a-meshtastic-lora-node-using-esp32-ble-and-python", "datePublished": "2025-12-06T15:51:27+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-12-06T15:51:27+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/laptop-as-a-meshtastic-lora-node-using-esp32-ble-and-python.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website", "articleBody": "Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website\n\nYou can now filter my articles by topic at https://illya.sh/threads/topics/\n\nQwen3-Embedding-0.6B is used to vectorize and embed all of the articles/threads, which are then tagged/categorized based on natural language tags for the category.\nThis allows me to define a new category by defining a new Python class with the topic/category name, description, URL path, and the query sting to embed and query against the thread embeddings.

This means there is about $4100-$1910=$2190 of margin on each ounce of refined gold. Almost all of this margin on the sale of an ounce of gold is pocketed by gold miners.\n\nLet's compute the profit per ounce of gold from the perspective of a miner. Gold miners generally sell gold to refineries at a fixed haircut over the spot price. This haircut is generally very small, ≈$10 which accounts mainly for refining and treatment costs. So with the numbers above (also see attached image), gold miners are making a profit of $4100-$(1500+400+10)=$2190 (the same number we computed above).\n\nThe larger the premium/gap of gold's spot price over its production costs, the larger is the profit for the miners. As the cost of labor and industrial production increases due to global monetary debasement, so will gold production costs. The same monetary debasement, combined with strong demand for gold will push its price further up. \n\nIn the next 2-3 years, I expect gold price to increase by a larger proportion than gold mining costs, as gold is under several positive price pressure points (central banks, USD alternatives, monetary debasement, etc). Thus, the margin over mining costs should remain high, leading to a sustained high profit per ounce of gold for miners.\n\nThis is why gold mining stocks are currently a great investment. The same is true for other miners, such as silver.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/1-oz-of-gold-production-cost-and-miner-profit", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/1-oz-of-gold-production-cost-and-miner-profit", "datePublished": "2025-11-23T13:58:39+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-23T13:58:39+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/1-oz-of-gold-production-cost-and-miner-profit.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "1 oz of Bullion Gold Costs ≈$1910 to Produce", "articleBody": "1 oz of Bullion Gold Costs ≈$1910 to Produce\n\nGold's current spot price is ≈$4100.

Those bonds come with small coupons, so relatively small interest payments.\n\nMore specifically, here is how MicroStrategy's/Strategy's outstanding outstanding convertible bond maturity, principal, coupon rate and total yearly interest  look like:\n\n2028     | $1.01B   @ 0.625%   | $6.3M\n2029     | $3.0B    @ 0%            | $0M\n2030A  | $0.8B     @ 0.625%  | $5M\n2030B  | $2.0B     @ 0%           | $0M\n2031     | $0.604B @ 0.875%  | $5.3M\n2032    | $0.8B       @ 2.25%     | $18M\n\n(Format: <year> | <principal> @ <coupon> | <anual interest>)\n\nIf you sum up the interest payments you’ll get ≈$34.6M/year in total.\n\nThe yearly revenue of MSTR's software services business is almost ≈$500M/year. However, their software portion of the business actually operates at ≈60M/year loss, when using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n\nStrategy advertises their software portion of the business as being in profit, but they \"manipulate\" those numbers a little. This \"manipulation\" involves MSTR not counting stock-based compensation as expenses.\n\nSo when you hear Strategy advertising profit from their software business - they're not using a legally recognized and standardized measure of profit (in the U.S. it's GAAP). So they take the GAAP software profit and then add some things back at their discretion (i.e. they don't count some expenses), thus turning a negative profit (loss) into a positive one.\n\nThis means that while their software business revenue can help them with having liquidity for interest payments - it doesn't cover those costs (since they operate at loss, it actually increases the total cost!).\n\nThus, Strategy finances their interest rate payments with a mixture of:\n\n➖ Existing reserves & short-term investments\n➖ Capital market instruments, such as issuing new equity or debt (main source)\n➖ Asset liquidation\n\nThe software revenue provides significant cashflow (compared to interest rate costs), so it can help with having cash readily available to make an interest payment (liquidity), but it doesn't effectively cover them, thus requiring financing from other sources.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-microstrategy-pays-interest-on-its-debt", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/how-microstrategy-pays-interest-on-its-debt", "datePublished": "2025-11-20T08:56:39+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-20T08:56:39+00:00", "keywords": "Illya Gerasymchuk, Financial & Software Engineer, financial markets, monetary policy, central banks, global liquidity, financial market structure, commodities, gold, silver, Bitcoin, crypto markets, AI systems, software engineering, financial law, machine learning, agentic AI systems, finance, cryptocurrency, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, blockchain", "author": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "publisher": {"@id": "https://illya.sh/#person"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/how-microstrategy-pays-interest-on-its-debt.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Strategy (MSTR) pays interest on its debt via a mixture of capital markets, software business cashflow,…", "articleBody": "Strategy (MSTR) pays interest on its debt via a mixture of capital markets, software business cashflow, existing reserves & investments and Bitcoin sales.\n\nMSTR's annual coupon payments are not that high - ≈$40M/year.

Once funding becomes unavailable (i.e. market isn't willing to lend at favorable interest rates), funding must come from asset liquidation (i.e. the sale of Bitcoin).\n\nThe availability of funding is mostly dependent on Bitcoin's price. As long as Bitcoin price and trend is favorable around the dates when the debt wall matures - MSTR should be able to continue their leveraged trade. MSTR share price vs Bitcoin NAV is also important. If MSTR trades a premium over Bitcoin's NAV it allows Microstrategy to short their own equity and long Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, an unfavorable Bitcoin price action environment (e.g. during a bear market) that coincides with debt repayment obligations may trigger the unwinding of this leveraged position, forcing MSTR to sell Bitcoin, thus putting further downwards price pressure on Bitcoin, which lowers Microstrategy's equity even more, which makes lender even less likely to lend. The end result is an even more degraded funding capacity, which at the limit leads to bankruptcy.\n\nDebt starts maturing from 2028 (≈$1B), but the most significant portion of ≈70%/$5.8B matures in 2029-2030.

        <p>China Is Hoarding Commodities<br><br>While the U.S. is pumping a crypto &amp; AI bubble, China is pumping their commodity reserves.<br><br>Not only PRC is limiting silver exports, but they&#x27;re also lowering the cost of commodity-related imports.<br><br>The net result will be more positive  commodity import/export ratio, i.e. more physical commodities within China, which will be used for strategic and industrial needs (China is the world&#x27;s number one producer).<br><br>It also means that there will be less commodities available outside of PRC, and since the global demand won&#x27;t decrease - that&#x27;s further positive price pressure on the commodity sector.<br><br>I have been writing about gold, silver and other commodities for over 2 years. The same bullish narrative remains valid. These geopolitical developments provide further confirmation.</p>

    <div class="thought-content">
        <p>Laptop as a Meshtastic LoRa Node Using ESP32, BLE and Python<br><br>Meshtastic exposes a BLE interface and comes with a nice Python library. So I connected to the ESP32 with a LoRA module over bluetooth, and was able to send and receive messages from a Python script running on a laptop.<br><br>Essentially, the laptop uses the microcontroller as a proxy for the sub-GHz antenna (EU_868/≈868 MHz in Europe), enabling it to send and receive LoRa messages via Meshtastic&#x27;s firmware. So effectively Bluetooth Low Energy is used as a proxy protocol for LoRa.<br><br>There were two nodes in the mesh - one connected to the laptop and another to a smartphone. Both nodes had the same channel name, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and ordering (channel id) setup. The laptop node was using Python to connect to the mesh via BLE and exchange messages. The smartphone was connected to the other node, and the official Meshtastic app was used to send and receive messages.<br><br>The setup is as follows:<br><br>💻 Laptop (Python)<br>   ⇅ BLE<br>📡 Node A (ESP32 + LoRa)<br>   ≈≈≈ 868 MHz LoRa mesh ≈≈≈<br>📡 Node B (ESP32 + LoRa)<br>   ⇅ BLE<br>📱 Phone (Meshtastic app)<br><br>So you don&#x27;t really need to program the ESP32 to make it a &quot;smart&quot; LoRa node. You can program all of the logic on your usual dev machine, and use BLE as a proxy for LoRa packets over Meshtastic. This is a great approach for iterative development, prototyping, proof of concepts and even final products. Of course, you can also put the smart node code on a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or even the microcontroller itself.</p>

        <p>Added Semantic Categorization Via Embeddings To Articles/Threads On My Website<br><br>You can now filter my articles by topic at <a href="https://illya.sh/threads/topics/" target="_blank">https://illya.sh/threads/topics/</a><br><br>Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is used to vectorize and embed all of the articles/threads, which are then tagged/categorized based on natural language tags for the category.<br>This allows me to define a new category by defining a new Python class with the topic/category name, description, URL path, and the query sting to embed and query against the thread embeddings. From there, all of the content is generated statically. <br><br>Everything runs 100% locally/offline. Model weights are pre-downloaded once - that&#x27;s the most time-consuming part. <br><br>The motivation for implementing this has to with the content&#x27;s volume. I have written over 180 articles/threads, but until now there was no categorization. So if you wanted to read an article on a particular topic, you&#x27;d either have to google it, ask an LLM or go through the list manually yourself. Now, there is an index with topics, which help navigating the content semantically.<br><br>Navigate to <a href="https://t.co/bXb1JWKD4d," target="_blank">https://t.co/bXb1JWKD4d,</a> select a topic, and you will be presented paginated list of all threads/articles matching that topic.</p>

It&#x27;s a short read, and together they will give you a good understanding on how Strategy operates (its business model), what are its main risks, what MSTR can and cannot do regarding debt repayments, and why you probably shouldn’t trust their marketing campaigns, including the statements made by Michael Saylor on X and various podcasts/videos where he appears.</p>

        <p>How the 1916 Fed Act Made Treasuries Prime Collateral<br><br>Before 1916, the Fed would only lend to banks against &quot;eligible paper&quot;, which included self-liquidating commercial loans and agricultural loans.<br><br>The Federal Reserve Act 1916 amendment expanded the Fed&#x27;s legal power to allow for lending to commercial banks against U.S. Treasuries (government bonds).<br><br>This effectively turned U.S. government debt into collateral backing Fed&#x27;s liabilities. This paved the way for the U.S. Treasuries to become the most used form of collateral in short-term wholesale debt markets (e.g. repo/repurchase agreements) today.</p>

        <p>1 oz of Gold: Production Cost and Miner Profit<br><br>1 oz of gold costs ≈$1500 to mine (AISC), ≈10$ to transport and refine and another ≈$400 in various other expenses.<br><br>In total, that sums to about ≈$1910 to get 1 ounce of gold from the ground to bullion gold bar.<br><br>Currently, gold trades at ≈$4100/oz (when you&#x27;re reading this it&#x27;s probably much higher 😄). This means there is about $4100-$1910=$2190 of margin on each ounce of refined gold. Almost all of this margin on the sale of an ounce of gold is pocketed by gold miners.<br><br>Let&#x27;s compute the profit per ounce of gold from the perspective of a miner. Gold miners generally sell gold to refineries at a fixed haircut over the spot price. This haircut is generally very small, ≈$10 which accounts mainly for refining and treatment costs. So with the numbers above (also see attached image), gold miners are making a profit of $4100-$(1500+400+10)=$2190 (the same number we computed above).<br><br>The larger the premium/gap of gold&#x27;s spot price over its production costs, the larger is the profit for the miners. As the cost of labor and industrial production increases due to global monetary debasement, so will gold production costs. The same monetary debasement, combined with strong demand for gold will push its price further up. <br><br>In the next 2-3 years, I expect gold price to increase by a larger proportion than gold mining costs, as gold is under several positive price pressure points (central banks, USD alternatives, monetary debasement, etc). Thus, the margin over mining costs should remain high, leading to a sustained high profit per ounce of gold for miners.<br><br>This is why gold mining stocks are currently a great investment. The same is true for other miners, such as silver.</p>

A lot of it is in the form of Michael Saylor&#x27;s videos, podcast appearances and posts on X.

        <p>How MicroStrategy Pays Interest On Its Debt?<br><br>The short answer is that MSTR finances its debt service via a mixture of:<br><br>➖ Software business cashflow<br>➖ Existing reserves &amp; short-term investments<br>➖ Capital market instruments, such as issuing new equity or debt<br>➖ Asset liquidation (Bitcoin sales)<br><br>MSTR&#x27;s annual coupon payments sum up to ≈$34.6M/year. Currently, virtually all of MSTR&#x27;s financial debt is in convertible bonds/senior notes. Those bonds come with small coupons, so relatively small interest payments.<br><br>More specifically, here is how MicroStrategy&#x27;s/Strategy&#x27;s outstanding outstanding convertible bond maturity, principal, coupon rate and total yearly interest  look like:<br><br>2028     | $1.01B   @ 0.625%   | $6.3M<br>2029     | $3.0B    @ 0%            | $0M<br>2030A  | $0.8B     @ 0.625%  | $5M<br>2030B  | $2.0B     @ 0%           | $0M<br>2031     | $0.604B @ 0.875%  | $5.3M<br>2032    | $0.8B       @ 2.25%     | $18M<br><br>(Format: &lt;year&gt; | &lt;principal&gt; @ &lt;coupon&gt; | &lt;anual interest&gt;)<br><br>If you sum up the interest payments you’ll get ≈$34.6M/year in total.<br><br>The yearly revenue of MSTR&#x27;s software services business is almost ≈$500M/year. However, their software portion of the business actually operates at ≈60M/year loss, when using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).<br><br>Strategy advertises their software portion of the business as being in profit, but they &quot;manipulate&quot; those numbers a little. This &quot;manipulation&quot; involves MSTR not counting stock-based compensation as expenses.<br><br>So when you hear Strategy advertising profit from their software business - they&#x27;re not using a legally recognized and standardized measure of profit (in the U.S. it&#x27;s GAAP). So they take the GAAP software profit and then add some things back at their discretion (i.e. they don&#x27;t count some expenses), thus turning a negative profit (loss) into a positive one.<br><br>This means that while their software business revenue can help them with having liquidity for interest payments - it doesn&#x27;t cover those costs (since they operate at loss, it actually increases the total cost!).<br><br>Thus, Strategy finances their interest rate payments with a mixture of:<br><br>➖ Existing reserves &amp; short-term investments<br>➖ Capital market instruments, such as issuing new equity or debt (main source)<br>➖ Asset liquidation<br><br>The software revenue provides significant cashflow (compared to interest rate costs), so it can help with having cash readily available to make an interest payment (liquidity), but it doesn&#x27;t effectively cover them, thus requiring financing from other sources.</p>

        <p>MicroStrategy Can&#x27;t Repay Its Debt In Equity/Stock<br><br>Most of MicroStrategy&#x27;s debt is in the form of convertible bonds, meaning that by default the principal and the coupons get repaid the cash. <br><br>The &quot;convertible&quot; part means the bondholder can choose to convert the bond into shares/equity instead, and then MSTR chooses how settle the conversion of the bond&#x27;s value in cash, equity or mix.<br><br>So MSTR cannot force the debt settlement/repayment in stock/equity - that&#x27;s simply an option that the bondholders/investors have. <br><br>The repayment can always be in cash assuming that MSTR is solvent, as most of the debt is unsecured, meaning that there is no specific collateral pledged against that debt. In case of insolvency, unsecured debt holders are treated as general creditors of the company, and are repaid out of the remaining assets only after secured debt holders are repaid, but before equity holders.</p>

        <p>MicroStrategy Is Dependent On Refinancing Capacity, Not Bitcoin Price<br><br>MSTR won&#x27;t have to sell Bitcoin if BTC price goes down, they&#x27;ll have to sell Bitcoin if they&#x27;re unable to acquire funding along the maturity of their debt wall. <br><br>MicroStrategy is essentially a leveraged trade on Bitcoin, based on the following cycle:<br><br>1️⃣ Acquire funding via debt or equity<br>2️⃣ Buy Bitcoin<br>3️⃣ Repeat<br><br>This cycle works for as long as MSTR is able to obtain funding. Once funding becomes unavailable (i.e. market isn&#x27;t willing to lend at favorable interest rates), funding must come from asset liquidation (i.e. the sale of Bitcoin).<br><br>The availability of funding is mostly dependent on Bitcoin&#x27;s price. As long as Bitcoin price and trend is favorable around the dates when the debt wall matures - MSTR should be able to continue their leveraged trade. MSTR share price vs Bitcoin NAV is also important. If MSTR trades a premium over Bitcoin&#x27;s NAV it allows Microstrategy to short their own equity and long Bitcoin.<br><br>However, an unfavorable Bitcoin price action environment (e.g. during a bear market) that coincides with debt repayment obligations may trigger the unwinding of this leveraged position, forcing MSTR to sell Bitcoin, thus putting further downwards price pressure on Bitcoin, which lowers Microstrategy&#x27;s equity even more, which makes lender even less likely to lend. The end result is an even more degraded funding capacity, which at the limit leads to bankruptcy.<br><br>Debt starts maturing from 2028 (≈$1B), but the most significant portion of ≈70%/$5.8B matures in 2029-2030. This is where the price of Bitcoin is of great importance for Microstrategy&#x27;s solvency.<br><br>So don&#x27;t expect Microstrategy to have pressure to sell significant amounts of Bitcoin before at least 2027, even if the Bitcoin price stays low.</p>

        <p>Russia will buy Silver as a strategic reserve until 2027<br><br>I&#x27;m not speculating on anything, this comes directly from the Russian legislation, namely the Federal Law № 419-ФЗ (in Russian/cyrilic: Федеральный закон от 30 ноября 2024 г. № 419-ФЗ) whose budget tables for 2025–2027 allocate ≈51.5 billion rubles (≈$640M) per year as budget for the &quot;acquisition of state reserves of precious metals and precious stones&quot;.<br><br>Silver falls explicitly under the definition of &quot;precious metals&quot;. More specifically, under Russian framework law № 41-ФЗ the term &quot;precious metals&quot; (&quot;драгоценные металлы&quot;) is explicitly defined as gold, silver, platinum and the metals of the platinum group.<br><br>In addition to the above, in the official explanatory note (пояснительная записка) to the draft of Federal Law № 419-ФЗ the Russian Ministry of Finance explicitly states that the plan is to acquire refined gold, refined silver, refined platinum and refined palladium for strategic goals.

        <p>This is how The Soviet Union kickstarted Eurodollar markets in the 1950&#x27;s<br><br>Eurodollars are USD deposits held at banks outside the U.S. Originally, they were held mostly in European jurisdictions, thus the &quot;Euro&quot; in the name.<br><br>URSS needed U.S. dollars for international trade, but they didn&#x27;t trust keeping balances directly in New York, as they feared that U.S. would freeze or seize those deposits.<br><br>So URSS placed their USD deposits in European banks, often via Soviet-linked banks. Those European banks then re-deposited or lent out those dollars to other banks and institutions.<br><br>I&#x27;ve written extensively how the policies of the current U.S. administration are a negative for the USD. Asian countries have been progressively moving away from USD, and this is a sign from Europe in that direction (but don&#x27;t expect heavy de-dollarization in the near future). <br><br>Overall, I view this as a net positive for the sovereignty of EU/Europe as a whole. A more developed financial system infrastructure is crucial for attracting the use of Euro, which is already the 2nd most used currency in the world.</p>
