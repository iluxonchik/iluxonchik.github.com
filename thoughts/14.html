        <p>🇺🇸🇨🇳Here's why trade war with China will hurt the US

The economic relationship between US & China is:
1️⃣US pays USD for Chinese goods
2️⃣China re-invests USD back into US bonds

Thus, the same USD comes back to US!

Tariffs = less imports = less US bond investment = higher yield</p>

        <p>🇨🇳China has been increasing their gold reserves YTD

Gold price keeps going up - major central banks continue to load up

Gold is a hedge against USD. Tariffs are a medium of USD weaponization
