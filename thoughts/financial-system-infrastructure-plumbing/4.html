        <p>US Treasury debt is likely to be among the assets purchased by those same banks that received QE funds from the central bank. so central bank&#x27;s QE injection may be used to purchase US Treasury debt at auctions, thus effectively monetizing the government debt 😁</p>

            <p>even if it doesn&#x27;t happen directly at the start - eventually QE also increases broad money, due to reduced balance sheet constraints and an increase in cash reserves, which needs to be invested ASAP. this leads to more lending and asset purchases</p>
