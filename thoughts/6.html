        <p>🧩 Here&#x27;s how a ZKP-powered surveillance system works:<br><br>1️⃣ Cameras feed live video into a zkML model<br>2️⃣ The model labels data as &quot;suspicious&quot; or &quot;non-suspicious&quot;<br>3️⃣ Only &quot;suspicious&quot; footage is stored &amp; reported<br>4️⃣ The zkML model is public, ensuring transparency</p>
