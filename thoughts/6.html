Russia's international reserves are as follows:
- 0.007% US Treasury bonds
- 35% Gold

Russia exports <1% to the US. Russia is a net exporter

This makes them protected from US sovereign risk (USD devaluation) & trade risk</p>

Billions of $ are flowing out of US markets. Let that liquidity be parked in the EU. All that's needed is inviting conditions

        <p>Of course, this also gives China leverage - if The People Bank's of China (China's Central Bank) dumps their US Securities in the market, it will skyrocket bond yields, by reducing their prices

Who will lend to the US then, and at what premium? And at 125% debt to GDP 😬</p>

        <p>China is the 2nd largest holder of US Treasury bonds - a staggering 23% of their foreign exchange reserves

This makes China extremely exposed to US systemic risk. Which is why tariffs will hit them double hard - at exports and at renminbi/Yuan due to falling #DXY

Not saying they can't sustain it though</p>

        <p>$VIX is a measure of expected volatility

So higher option price = protection against more volatility</p>
