        <p>🚨 this doesn't mean that you shouldn't invest into US stocks or that you can't make money there

yes, it's a bubble - but that's the state of the global financial system. some areas are less of a bubble than others

also, US economy won't crash overnight like many predict here</p>

        <p>🇪🇺 in the EU, Bitcoin still hasn't reached a new all time high

but a little bit more depreciation of EUR against USD can finally bring the FIAT party to the Europeans as well 😂

although in these cases being late to the party is better</p>

        <p>🇷🇺 Bank of Russia explicitly states 12-13% as the average target key interest rate for 2026

and that's exactly what the bond market is pricing in

that's what i mean by this not requiring advanced quantitative or technical analysis  😄

that BTC was seized as a part of criminal proceedings. German Code of Criminal Procedure (111p), allows such sales if there's a risk of significant value loss

        <p>i understand that these are secondary tariffs, but there is a grand total of 0% chance of that going in action for any substancial amount of time

🇨🇳 China is Russia's main trading partner. do you really think the US economy can sustain 100% tariffs on their main import source?</p>

            <p>a reminder that Russia doesn't trade with USA anymore 🇺🇸🤝🇷🇺 

so it's not clear what 100% or 9999% tariffs on Russia will achieve

Russia's been offloading US securities for gold since 2018

Russia's exports to the US are less than 1% of the total</p>
