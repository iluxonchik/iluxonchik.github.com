It is not by chance that this central bank accounting item explicitly includes \"gold\" in its name.\n\nThe Forbes article also seems to assume that miner profit margins don't spread cross-border.\n\nAnother thing that the article omits is that a central bank can buy gold without expanding the base monetary base (i.e. \"printing\" new currency), for example by swapping FX reserves for gold via a single or multi-leg sale.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/even-as-central-banks-bought-gold-the-market-analysts.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/even-as-central-banks-bought-gold-the-market-analysts.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-19T15:38:09+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-19T15:38:09+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/ae0328c9-090f-51a8-af82-737c8d103030.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Putin Instructed Central Bank of Russia To Buy Gold In 2005", "articleBody": "Putin Instructed Central Bank of Russia To Buy Gold In 2005\n\nIn 20 years, Russia's share of gold in their central bank's international reserves account increased by a factor of ≈12.1 times.\n\nAt the start of 2026, gold represents ≈43% of Bank of Russia's (BoR) international reserves. Back in 2005, gold accounted for a mere ≈3.5% of the same reserves account.\n\nThe move to gold was mainly motivated by the desire to diversify away from the U.S. Dollar and the explicit goal of increasing BoR's holdings of gold relative to foreign exchange assets. On November 22nd 2005 Putin stated:\n\n➖ \"I believe it's necessary for the Central Bank to pay more attention to precious metals within the territory of the Russian Federation when forming gold and foreign-currency reserves. Those reserves are even called 'gold and foreign-currency' reserves. There's nothing to be shy about here.\"\n\nSince Vladimir Putin instructed Bank of Russia to start buying more gold, gold is up ≈840%, i.e. almost 10 times. In the same period, S&P 500 TR increased ≈726%, or almost 9 times. This means that Putin's strategy outperformed the U.S. stock market index by ≈14%.

A quick search didn't yield precise figures for 2026, as it appears that that information is not reported publicly in detail. The access to that gold at BoE is currently blocked, over a legal dispute regarding who has the authority/control over that gold - Maduro-appointed BCV board or Guaidó-appointed board. Thus, a significant portion of Venezuela's gold is abroad and frozen, which matters in terms of geopolitical risk.\n\nBNV's 20% are relatively high gold amounts against the central bank's total balance sheet size, surpassing U.S.'s Fed (≈16%), China's PBoC (≈5%) and just above European Union's ECB + Eurosystem (≈19.1%), but well behind Russia's BoR (≈36%).", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/venezuelas-central-bank-monetary-gold-holdings-constitute-20.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/venezuelas-central-bank-monetary-gold-holdings-constitute-20.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-08T12:13:42+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-08T12:13:42+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/b27f4f3e-34be-54a3-ac45-60886c633396.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "In 2017, Venezuelan Central Bank (Banco Central de Venezuela/BCV) held ≈162 tonnes of monetary gold in its ba...", "articleBody": "In 2017, Venezuelan Central Bank (Banco Central de Venezuela/BCV) held ≈162 tonnes of monetary gold in its balance sheet\n\nBy 2025, that number was reduced by ≈67%, down to ≈53 tonnes.\n\nI'll do a more detailed breakdown of Venezuela's gold holdings relative their balance sheet size in a follow-up post.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/in-2017-venezuelan-central-bank-banco-central-de-venezuela.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/in-2017-venezuelan-central-bank-banco-central-de-venezuela.html", "datePublished": "2026-01-03T19:47:29+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-01-03T19:47:29+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/95146530-c00f-5786-a04c-22dce1c9bb48.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Ruble was the best performing major currency of 2025, and it's easy to understand why", "articleBody": "Ruble was the best performing major currency of 2025, and it's easy to understand why\n\nWhat Russia did is replace USD-denominated securities (treasuries, bonds, etc) with gold.\n\nGold is almost 40% of Russia's Central bank balance sheet, compare it to ≈20% for European Union, ≈16% for U.S. and ≈5% for China.

More specifically, under Russian framework law № 41-ФЗ the term \"precious metals\" (\"драгоценные металлы\") is explicitly defined as gold, silver, platinum and the metals of the platinum group.\n\nIn addition to the above, in the official explanatory note (пояснительная записка) to the draft of Federal Law № 419-ФЗ the Russian Ministry of Finance explicitly states that the plan is to acquire refined gold, refined silver, refined platinum and refined palladium for strategic goals. More specifically, the aim is to increase the share of \"highly liquid valuables\" in the State Fund of Precious Metals and Precious Stones of the Russian Federation (Госфонд России).", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/russia-will-buy-silver-as-a-strategic-reserve-until-2027.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/russia-will-buy-silver-as-a-strategic-reserve-until-2027.html", "datePublished": "2025-11-14T19:14:59+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-14T19:14:59+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/87cfc537-2114-5ada-a661-009f95862336.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "Gold as a percentage of balance sheet size in Central Banks (ranked):", "articleBody": "Gold as a percentage of balance sheet size in Central Banks (ranked):\n\n🇯🇵 Japan (MoF + BoJ): ≈2.4%\n🇨🇳 China (PBoC): ≈4.5%\n🇺🇸 U.S. (Fed gold certificates): ≈15.9%\n🇪🇺 European Union (ECB + Eurosystem): ≈19.4%\n🇷🇺 Russia (BoR): ≈36.1%\n\nAll of the above will expand their balance sheets, but it's mostly China & Russia actively buying more gold.\n\nConclusions you can take from here:\n\n➖ China's gold holdings are relatively small when compared to their Central Bank's balance sheet size, and given their efforts to promote renminbi as the invoice currency worldwide, you can expect PBoC to continue their gold purchases for the medium-long term. The gold share must at least double to come close to the current reserve currency - the U.S. dollar. All reserve currencies started on a gold and/or silver standard - and the pressure towards this direction won't be different for renminbi/yuan. When the USD became the world reserve currency with the Bretton-Woods agreement - gold certificates accounted for ≈40% of the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n➖ Russia has built up a massive balance sheet capacity for the future. Once the international trade markets with Russia re-open, there will be a plenty of reserves to back-up a massive wave of Ruble credit. Expect Russian capital markets to rally then.\n\n➖ European Union has a healthy relative position. Given that the Euro is currently the closest alternative to the U.S. Dollar - it's a good idea to both, expand gold reserves and promote capital markets. The latter is an explicit goal via the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Given that EU will further expand the balance sheet, it's necessary to increase the gold reserves - repricing won't be enough. Gold will make Euro more attractive, and with it the FX holdings of Euro by sovereigns.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/gold-as-a-percentage-of-balance-sheet-size-in-central-banks.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/gold-as-a-percentage-of-balance-sheet-size-in-central-banks.html", "datePublished": "2025-11-10T16:26:09+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-10T16:26:09+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/2ec60c80-04bc-53bc-9203-5f48185df02a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "a kind reminder that higher oil prices benefit Russia and Ruble", "articleBody": "a kind reminder that higher oil prices benefit Russia and Ruble\n\nU.S. puts sanctions on Russia --> Oil price increases --> Ruble price increases\n\nThis is driven by how Russia's National Wealth Fund (NWF) operates, plus the fact that both NWF and Russia's Central Bank have almost no exposure to USD", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/a-kind-reminder-that-higher-oil-prices-benefit-russia-and.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/a-kind-reminder-that-higher-oil-prices-benefit-russia-and.html", "datePublished": "2025-10-24T21:47:07+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-24T21:47:07+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/0923ee87-fabc-51b8-8558-16ad95ad443a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "in Russia, besides the Bank of Russia there's also the National Wealth Fund (NWF), which is operated by the M...", "articleBody": "in Russia, besides the Bank of Russia there's also the National Wealth Fund (NWF), which is operated by the Ministry of Finance\n\nin China, there's policy banks, such as China Development Bank which are supported by PBoC's facilities", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/in-russia-besides-the-bank-of-russia-theres-also-the.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/in-russia-besides-the-bank-of-russia-theres-also-the.html", "datePublished": "2025-08-16T11:30:06+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-08-16T11:30:06+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/db0c1973-b2b5-56ee-80d1-541f8d9cea46.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "so did Russia really buy more gold?", "articleBody": "so did Russia really buy more gold?\n\nyes! despite CBR's gold reserves remaining unchanged -

        <p>Even As Central Banks Bought Gold, The Market Analysts Remained Bearish<br><br>* This goes to the list of &quot;things that are obvious in hindsight&quot;<br><br>In 2014 Forbes published an opinion saying that increased gold buying by Central Bank of Russia (CBR) isn&#x27;t an indicator of positive price pressures for gold.<br><br>Gold&#x27;s price has more than quadrupled since then, going from ≈$1600/oz in November 2014 to ≈$4600/oz as of January 19th 2026.<br><br>The article frames the purchase as &quot;forced&quot;, when commenting the fact that CBR decided to increase the share of gold in the &quot;gold and foreign exchange reserve assets&quot; item in their balance sheet. It is not by chance that this central bank accounting item explicitly includes &quot;gold&quot; in its name.<br><br>The Forbes article also seems to assume that miner profit margins don&#x27;t spread cross-border.<br><br>Another thing that the article omits is that a central bank can buy gold without expanding the base monetary base (i.e. &quot;printing&quot; new currency), for example by swapping FX reserves for gold via a single or multi-leg sale.</p>

    <div class="thought-content">
        <p>Putin Instructed Central Bank of Russia To Buy Gold In 2005<br><br>In 20 years, Russia&#x27;s share of gold in their central bank&#x27;s international reserves account increased by a factor of ≈12.1 times.<br><br>At the start of 2026, gold represents ≈43% of Bank of Russia&#x27;s (BoR) international reserves. Back in 2005, gold accounted for a mere ≈3.5% of the same reserves account.<br><br>The move to gold was mainly motivated by the desire to diversify away from the U.S. Dollar and the explicit goal of increasing BoR&#x27;s holdings of gold relative to foreign exchange assets. On November 22nd 2005 Putin stated:<br><br>➖ &quot;I believe it&#x27;s necessary for the Central Bank to pay more attention to precious metals within the territory of the Russian Federation when forming gold and foreign-currency reserves. Those reserves are even called &#x27;gold and foreign-currency&#x27; reserves. There&#x27;s nothing to be shy about here.&quot;<br><br>Since Vladimir Putin instructed Bank of Russia to start buying more gold, gold is up ≈840%, i.e. almost 10 times. In the same period, S&amp;P 500 TR increased ≈726%, or almost 9 times. This means that Putin&#x27;s strategy outperformed the U.S. stock market index by ≈14%. Perhaps the president of Russia should start his own investment fund?</p>

        <p>Venezuela&#x27;s Central Bank Monetary Gold Holdings Constitute ≈20% of Their Balance Sheet<br><br>Gold is also ≈47% of Venezuela&#x27;s international reserve assets.<br><br>This comes directly from Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV), which reports a total of ≈53 tonnes of gold worth ≈0.6 Trillion VES (Venezuelan Bolívar, also known as Bs), or ≈5.58 billion USD.<br><br>In 2021, Reuters reported that ≈31 tonnes of Venezuela&#x27;s Centeal Bank gold was stored in the UK, under the custody of Bank of England (BoE). A quick search didn&#x27;t yield precise figures for 2026, as it appears that that information is not reported publicly in detail. The access to that gold at BoE is currently blocked, over a legal dispute regarding who has the authority/control over that gold - Maduro-appointed BCV board or Guaidó-appointed board. Thus, a significant portion of Venezuela&#x27;s gold is abroad and frozen, which matters in terms of geopolitical risk.<br><br>BNV&#x27;s 20% are relatively high gold amounts against the central bank&#x27;s total balance sheet size, surpassing U.S.&#x27;s Fed (≈16%), China&#x27;s PBoC (≈5%) and just above European Union&#x27;s ECB + Eurosystem (≈19.1%), but well behind Russia&#x27;s BoR (≈36%).</p>

        <p>Gold as a percentage of balance sheet size in Central Banks (ranked):<br><br>🇯🇵 Japan (MoF + BoJ): ≈2.4%<br>🇨🇳 China (PBoC): ≈4.5%<br>🇺🇸 U.S. (Fed gold certificates): ≈15.9%<br>🇪🇺 European Union (ECB + Eurosystem): ≈19.4%<br>🇷🇺 Russia (BoR): ≈36.1%<br><br>All of the above will expand their balance sheets, but it&#x27;s mostly China &amp; Russia actively buying more gold.<br><br>Conclusions you can take from here:<br><br>➖ China&#x27;s gold holdings are relatively small when compared to their Central Bank&#x27;s balance sheet size, and given their efforts to promote renminbi as the invoice currency worldwide, you can expect PBoC to continue their gold purchases for the medium-long term. The gold share must at least double to come close to the current reserve currency - the U.S. dollar. All reserve currencies started on a gold and/or silver standard - and the pressure towards this direction won&#x27;t be different for renminbi/yuan. When the USD became the world reserve currency with the Bretton-Woods agreement - gold certificates accounted for ≈40% of the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet.<br><br>➖ Russia has built up a massive balance sheet capacity for the future. Once the international trade markets with Russia re-open, there will be a plenty of reserves to back-up a massive wave of Ruble credit. Expect Russian capital markets to rally then.<br><br>➖ European Union has a healthy relative position. Given that the Euro is currently the closest alternative to the U.S. Dollar - it&#x27;s a good idea to both, expand gold reserves and promote capital markets. The latter is an explicit goal via the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Given that EU will further expand the balance sheet, it&#x27;s necessary to increase the gold reserves - repricing won&#x27;t be enough. Gold will make Euro more attractive, and with it the FX holdings of Euro by sovereigns.</p>
