Only if you violated the rules above, authorities could force you to liquidate your gold to PBoC at a discount over the spot price.\n\nThis is a big contrast with the gold ban in the United States via Executive Order 6102 in 1933, which required all persons to surrender/liquidate their gold coins, bullion and certificates to the state. Moreover, in 1933 the U.S. government credited you $20.67 per oz gold that you surrender. About a year later, the same government that forced people to liquidate their gold at $20.67, proceeded to raise the price of gold to $35 per oz (at that time the price of the gold was fixed by the government, not determined by market price action like today). So the U.S. government made an instant ≈70% profit on the public's gold.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/china-banned-gold-silver-as-money-in-1983.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/china-banned-gold-silver-as-money-in-1983.html", "datePublished": "2026-02-16T11:25:50+00:00", "dateModified": "2026-02-16T11:25:50+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/a34ea166-2c05-560d-92e7-952d819d595c.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "China Also Banned Gold & Silver In 1983", "articleBody": "China Also Banned Gold & Silver In 1983\n\nBut unlike in 1933 in the U.S., there was no global ban on the public owning gold & silver.

The gold share must at least double to come close to the current reserve currency - the U.S. dollar. All reserve currencies started on a gold and/or silver standard - and the pressure towards this direction won't be different for renminbi/yuan. When the USD became the world reserve currency with the Bretton-Woods agreement - gold certificates accounted for ≈40% of the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n➖ Russia has built up a massive balance sheet capacity for the future. Once the international trade markets with Russia re-open, there will be a plenty of reserves to back-up a massive wave of Ruble credit. Expect Russian capital markets to rally then.\n\n➖ European Union has a healthy relative position. Given that the Euro is currently the closest alternative to the U.S. Dollar - it's a good idea to both, expand gold reserves and promote capital markets. The latter is an explicit goal via the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Given that EU will further expand the balance sheet, it's necessary to increase the gold reserves - repricing won't be enough. Gold will make Euro more attractive, and with it the FX holdings of Euro by sovereigns.", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/gold-as-a-percentage-of-balance-sheet-size-in-central-banks.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/gold-as-a-percentage-of-balance-sheet-size-in-central-banks.html", "datePublished": "2025-11-10T16:26:09+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-11-10T16:26:09+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/images/2ec60c80-04bc-53bc-9203-5f48185df02a.jpg"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "soon i'll write a thread on how central banks/governments reevaluate gold and how the monetary gains can be u...", "articleBody": "soon i'll write a thread on how central banks/governments reevaluate gold and how the monetary gains can be used to cover central bank and/or government debt\n\ni'll add a link to it in this thread once it’s ready", "url": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/soon-ill-write-a-thread-on-how-central-banks-governments.html", "mainEntityOfPage": "https://illya.sh/thoughts/soon-ill-write-a-thread-on-how-central-banks-governments.html", "datePublished": "2025-09-05T23:10:35+00:00", "dateModified": "2025-09-05T23:10:35+00:00", "keywords": "crypto, finance, law, AI, software development, economics, blockchain, markets", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Illya Gerasymchuk"}, "image": "https://illya.sh/staticthoughts/data/illya_gerasymchuk_thoughts.webp"}, {"@type": "BlogPosting", "headline": "retail CBDC is the digital version of currency -

        <p>China Banned Gold &amp; Silver As Money In 1983<br><br>While it remained legal to hold gold as an individual in PRC, you couldn&#x27;t:<br>- Use gold/silver as money (unit of account/pricing)<br>- Trade gold/silver privately (you could only sell it to PBoC)<br>- Lend or pledge (use as collateral) gold/silver<br>- Act as a dealer of gold, unless authorized by PBoC<br><br>So effectively, as an individual in PRC, you could only sell your gold &amp; silver through the PBoC system, but it was fully lawful to own those metals. Only if you violated the rules above, authorities could force you to liquidate your gold to PBoC at a discount over the spot price.<br><br>This is a big contrast with the gold ban in the United States via Executive Order 6102 in 1933, which required all persons to surrender/liquidate their gold coins, bullion and certificates to the state. Moreover, in 1933 the U.S. government credited you $20.67 per oz gold that you surrender. About a year later, the same government that forced people to liquidate their gold at $20.67, proceeded to raise the price of gold to $35 per oz (at that time the price of the gold was fixed by the government, not determined by market price action like today). So the U.S. government made an instant ≈70% profit on the public&#x27;s gold.</p>

        <p>China Also Banned Gold &amp; Silver In 1983<br><br>But unlike in 1933 in the U.S., there was no global ban on the public owning gold &amp; silver. The public was however not allowed to use it as money, collateral, lend it or trade it.

        <p>Gold as a percentage of balance sheet size in Central Banks (ranked):<br><br>🇯🇵 Japan (MoF + BoJ): ≈2.4%<br>🇨🇳 China (PBoC): ≈4.5%<br>🇺🇸 U.S. (Fed gold certificates): ≈15.9%<br>🇪🇺 European Union (ECB + Eurosystem): ≈19.4%<br>🇷🇺 Russia (BoR): ≈36.1%<br><br>All of the above will expand their balance sheets, but it&#x27;s mostly China &amp; Russia actively buying more gold.<br><br>Conclusions you can take from here:<br><br>➖ China&#x27;s gold holdings are relatively small when compared to their Central Bank&#x27;s balance sheet size, and given their efforts to promote renminbi as the invoice currency worldwide, you can expect PBoC to continue their gold purchases for the medium-long term. The gold share must at least double to come close to the current reserve currency - the U.S. dollar. All reserve currencies started on a gold and/or silver standard - and the pressure towards this direction won&#x27;t be different for renminbi/yuan. When the USD became the world reserve currency with the Bretton-Woods agreement - gold certificates accounted for ≈40% of the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet.<br><br>➖ Russia has built up a massive balance sheet capacity for the future. Once the international trade markets with Russia re-open, there will be a plenty of reserves to back-up a massive wave of Ruble credit. Expect Russian capital markets to rally then.<br><br>➖ European Union has a healthy relative position. Given that the Euro is currently the closest alternative to the U.S. Dollar - it&#x27;s a good idea to both, expand gold reserves and promote capital markets. The latter is an explicit goal via the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Given that EU will further expand the balance sheet, it&#x27;s necessary to increase the gold reserves - repricing won&#x27;t be enough. Gold will make Euro more attractive, and with it the FX holdings of Euro by sovereigns.</p>
